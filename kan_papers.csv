KAN: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks,"Inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, we propose Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) as promising alternatives to Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). While MLPs have fixed activation functions on nodes (""neurons""), KANs have learnable activation functions on edges (""weights""). KANs have no linear weights at all -- every weight parameter is replaced by a univariate function parametrized as a spline. We show that this seemingly simple change makes KANs outperform MLPs in terms of accuracy and interpretability. For accuracy, much smaller KANs can achieve comparable or better accuracy than much larger MLPs in data fitting and PDE solving. Theoretically and empirically, KANs possess faster neural scaling laws than MLPs. For interpretability, KANs can be intuitively visualized and can easily interact with human users. Through two examples in mathematics and physics, KANs are shown to be useful collaborators helping scientists (re)discover mathematical and physical laws. In summary, KANs are promising alternatives for MLPs, opening opportunities for further improving today's deep learning models which rely heavily on MLPs.

Biology-inspired joint distribution neurons based on Hierarchical Correlation Reconstruction allowing for multidirectional neural networks,"Biological neural networks seem qualitatively superior (e.g. in learning, flexibility, robustness) to current artificial like Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) or Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN). Simultaneously, in contrast to them: biological have fundamentally multidirectional signal propagation \cite{axon}, also of probability distributions e.g. for uncertainty estimation, and are believed not being able to use standard backpropagation training \cite{backprop}. There are proposed novel artificial neurons based on HCR (Hierarchical Correlation Reconstruction) allowing to remove the above low level differences: with neurons containing local joint distribution model (of its connections), representing joint density on normalized variables as just linear combination of $(f_\mathbf{j})$ orthonormal polynomials: $ρ(\mathbf{x})=\sum_{\mathbf{j}\in B} a_\mathbf{j} f_\mathbf{j}(\mathbf{x})$ for $\mathbf{x} \in [0,1]^d$ and $B\subset \mathbb{N}^d$ some chosen basis. By various index summations of such $(a_\mathbf{j})_{\mathbf{j}\in B}$ tensor as neuron parameters, we get simple formulas for e.g. conditional expected values for propagation in any direction, like $E[x|y,z]$, $E[y|x]$, which degenerate to KAN-like parametrization if restricting to pairwise dependencies. Such HCR network can also propagate probability distributions (also joint) like $ρ(y,z|x)$. It also allows for additional training approaches, like direct $(a_\mathbf{j})$ estimation, through tensor decomposition, or more biologically plausible information bottleneck training: layers directly influencing only neighbors, optimizing content to maximize information about the next layer, and minimizing about the previous to remove noise, extract crucial information.

Chebyshev Polynomial-Based Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks: An Efficient Architecture for Nonlinear Function Approximation,"Accurate approximation of complex nonlinear functions is a fundamental challenge across many scientific and engineering domains. Traditional neural network architectures, such as Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), often struggle to efficiently capture intricate patterns and irregularities present in high-dimensional functions. This paper presents the Chebyshev Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (Chebyshev KAN), a new neural network architecture inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, incorporating the powerful approximation capabilities of Chebyshev polynomials. By utilizing learnable functions parametrized by Chebyshev polynomials on the network's edges, Chebyshev KANs enhance flexibility, efficiency, and interpretability in function approximation tasks. We demonstrate the efficacy of Chebyshev KANs through experiments on digit classification, synthetic function approximation, and fractal function generation, highlighting their superiority over traditional MLPs in terms of parameter efficiency and interpretability. Our comprehensive evaluation, including ablation studies, confirms the potential of Chebyshev KANs to address longstanding challenges in nonlinear function approximation, paving the way for further advancements in various scientific and engineering applications.

TKAN: Temporal Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks,"Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have revolutionized many areas of machine learning, particularly in natural language and data sequence processing. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) has demonstrated its ability to capture long-term dependencies in sequential data.

Predictive Modeling of Flexible EHD Pumps using Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks,"We present a novel approach to predicting the pressure and flow rate of flexible electrohydrodynamic pumps using the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network. Inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, KAN replaces fixed activation functions with learnable spline-based activation functions, enabling it to approximate complex nonlinear functions more effectively than traditional models like Multi-Layer Perceptron and Random Forest. We evaluated KAN on a dataset of flexible EHD pump parameters and compared its performance against RF, and MLP models. KAN achieved superior predictive accuracy, with Mean Squared Errors of 12.186 and 0.001 for pressure and flow rate predictions, respectively. The symbolic formulas extracted from KAN provided insights into the nonlinear relationships between input parameters and pump performance. These findings demonstrate that KAN offers exceptional accuracy and interpretability, making it a promising alternative for predictive modeling in electrohydrodynamic pumping.

Smooth Kolmogorov Arnold networks enabling structural knowledge representation,"Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) offer an efficient and interpretable alternative to traditional multi-layer perceptron (MLP) architectures due to their finite network topology. However, according to the results of Kolmogorov and Vitushkin, the representation of generic smooth functions by KAN implementations using analytic functions constrained to a finite number of cutoff points cannot be exact. Hence, the convergence of KAN throughout the training process may be limited. This paper explores the relevance of smoothness in KANs, proposing that smooth, structurally informed KANs can achieve equivalence to MLPs in specific function classes. By leveraging inherent structural knowledge, KANs may reduce the data required for training and mitigate the risk of generating hallucinated predictions, thereby enhancing model reliability and performance in computational biomedicine.

Wav-KAN: Wavelet Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks,"In this paper, we introduce Wav-KAN, an innovative neural network architecture that leverages the Wavelet Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (Wav-KAN) framework to enhance interpretability and performance. Traditional multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) and even recent advancements like Spl-KAN face challenges related to interpretability, training speed, robustness, computational efficiency, and performance. Wav-KAN addresses these limitations by incorporating wavelet functions into the Kolmogorov-Arnold network structure, enabling the network to capture both high-frequency and low-frequency components of the input data efficiently. Wavelet-based approximations employ orthogonal or semi-orthogonal basis and maintain a balance between accurately representing the underlying data structure and avoiding overfitting to the noise. While continuous wavelet transform (CWT) has a lot of potentials, we also employed discrete wavelet transform (DWT) for multiresolution analysis, which obviated the need for recalculation of the previous steps in finding the details. Analogous to how water conforms to the shape of its container, Wav-KAN adapts to the data structure, resulting in enhanced accuracy, faster training speeds, and increased robustness compared to Spl-KAN and MLPs. Our results highlight the potential of Wav-KAN as a powerful tool for developing interpretable and high-performance neural networks, with applications spanning various fields. This work sets the stage for further exploration and implementation of Wav-KAN in frameworks such as PyTorch and TensorFlow, aiming to make wavelets in KAN as widespread as activation functions like ReLU and sigmoid in universal approximation theory (UAT). The codes to replicate the simulations are available at https://github.com/zavareh1/Wav-KAN.

Endowing Interpretability for Neural Cognitive Diagnosis by Efficient Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks,"In the realm of intelligent education, cognitive diagnosis plays a crucial role in subsequent recommendation tasks attributed to the revealed students' proficiency in knowledge concepts. Although neural network-based neural cognitive diagnosis models (CDMs) have exhibited significantly better performance than traditional models, neural cognitive diagnosis is criticized for the poor model interpretability due to the multi-layer perception (MLP) employed, even with the monotonicity assumption. Therefore, this paper proposes to empower the interpretability of neural cognitive diagnosis models through efficient kolmogorov-arnold networks (KANs), named KAN2CD, where KANs are designed to enhance interpretability in two manners. Specifically, in the first manner, KANs are directly used to replace the used MLPs in existing neural CDMs; while in the second manner, the student embedding, exercise embedding, and concept embedding are directly processed by several KANs, and then their outputs are further combined and learned in a unified KAN to get final predictions. To overcome the problem of training KANs slowly, we modify the implementation of original KANs to accelerate the training. Experiments on four real-world datasets show that the proposed KA2NCD exhibits better performance than traditional CDMs, and the proposed KA2NCD still has a bit of performance leading even over the existing neural CDMs. More importantly, the learned structures of KANs enable the proposed KA2NCD to hold as good interpretability as traditional CDMs, which is superior to existing neural CDMs. Besides, the training cost of the proposed KA2NCD is competitive to existing models.

A First Look at Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks in Surrogate-assisted Evolutionary Algorithms,"Surrogate-assisted Evolutionary Algorithm (SAEA) is an essential method for solving expensive expensive problems. Utilizing surrogate models to substitute the optimization function can significantly reduce reliance on the function evaluations during the search process, thereby lowering the optimization costs. The construction of surrogate models is a critical component in SAEAs, with numerous machine learning algorithms playing a pivotal role in the model-building phase. This paper introduces Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) as surrogate models within SAEAs, examining their application and effectiveness. We employ KANs for regression and classification tasks, focusing on the selection of promising solutions during the search process, which consequently reduces the number of expensive function evaluations. Experimental results indicate that KANs demonstrate commendable performance within SAEAs, effectively decreasing the number of function calls and enhancing the optimization efficiency. The relevant code is publicly accessible and can be found in the GitHub repository.

DeepOKAN: Deep Operator Network Based on Kolmogorov Arnold Networks for Mechanics Problems,"The modern digital engineering design often requires costly repeated simulations for different scenarios. The prediction capability of neural networks (NNs) makes them suitable surrogates for providing design insights. However, only a few NNs can efficiently handle complex engineering scenario predictions. We introduce a new version of the neural operators called DeepOKAN, which utilizes Kolmogorov Arnold networks (KANs) rather than the conventional neural network architectures. Our DeepOKAN uses Gaussian radial basis functions (RBFs) rather than the B-splines. RBFs offer good approximation properties and are typically computationally fast. The KAN architecture, combined with RBFs, allows DeepOKANs to represent better intricate relationships between input parameters and output fields, resulting in more accurate predictions across various mechanics problems. Specifically, we evaluate DeepOKAN's performance on several mechanics problems, including 1D sinusoidal waves, 2D orthotropic elasticity, and transient Poisson's problem, consistently achieving lower training losses and more accurate predictions compared to traditional DeepONets. This approach should pave the way for further improving the performance of neural operators.

Kolmogorov-Arnold Network for Satellite Image Classification in Remote Sensing,"In this research, we propose the first approach for integrating the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) with various pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models for remote sensing (RS) scene classification tasks using the EuroSAT dataset. Our novel methodology, named KCN, aims to replace traditional Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) with KAN to enhance classification performance. We employed multiple CNN-based models, including VGG16, MobileNetV2, EfficientNet, ConvNeXt, ResNet101, and Vision Transformer (ViT), and evaluated their performance when paired with KAN. Our experiments demonstrated that KAN achieved high accuracy with fewer training epochs and parameters. Specifically, ConvNeXt paired with KAN showed the best performance, achieving 94% accuracy in the first epoch, which increased to 96% and remained consistent across subsequent epochs. The results indicated that KAN and MLP both achieved similar accuracy, with KAN performing slightly better in later epochs. By utilizing the EuroSAT dataset, we provided a robust testbed to investigate whether KAN is suitable for remote sensing classification tasks. Given that KAN is a novel algorithm, there is substantial capacity for further development and optimization, suggesting that KCN offers a promising alternative for efficient image analysis in the RS field.

FourierKAN-GCF: Fourier Kolmogorov-Arnold Network -- An Effective and Efficient Feature Transformation for Graph Collaborative Filtering,"Graph Collaborative Filtering (GCF) has achieved state-of-the-art performance for recommendation tasks. However, most GCF structures simplify the feature transformation and nonlinear operation during message passing in the graph convolution network (GCN). We revisit these two components and discover that a part of feature transformation and nonlinear operation during message passing in GCN can improve the representation of GCF, but increase the difficulty of training.
  In this work, we propose a simple and effective graph-based recommendation model called FourierKAN-GCF. Specifically, it utilizes a novel Fourier Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) to replace the multilayer perceptron (MLP) as a part of the feature transformation during message passing in GCN, which improves the representation power of GCF and is easy to train. We further employ message dropout and node dropout strategies to improve the representation power and robustness of the model.

iKAN: Global Incremental Learning with KAN for Human Activity Recognition Across Heterogeneous Datasets,"This work proposes an incremental learning (IL) framework for wearable sensor human activity recognition (HAR) that tackles two challenges simultaneously: catastrophic forgetting and non-uniform inputs. The scalable framework, iKAN, pioneers IL with Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) to replace multi-layer perceptrons as the classifier that leverages the local plasticity and global stability of splines. To adapt KAN for HAR, iKAN uses task-specific feature branches and a feature redistribution layer. Unlike existing IL methods that primarily adjust the output dimension or the number of classifier nodes to adapt to new tasks, iKAN focuses on expanding the feature extraction branches to accommodate new inputs from different sensor modalities while maintaining consistent dimensions and the number of classifier outputs. Continual learning across six public HAR datasets demonstrated the iKAN framework's incremental learning performance, with a last performance of 84.9\% (weighted F1 score) and an average incremental performance of 81.34\%, which significantly outperforms the two existing incremental learning methods, such as EWC (51.42\%) and experience replay (59.92\%).

Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks for Time Series: Bridging Predictive Power and Interpretability,"Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) is a groundbreaking model recently proposed by the MIT team, representing a revolutionary approach with the potential to be a game-changer in the field. This innovative concept has rapidly garnered worldwide interest within the AI community. Inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, KAN utilizes spline-parametrized univariate functions in place of traditional linear weights, enabling them to dynamically learn activation patterns and significantly enhancing interpretability.

T-KAN is designed to detect concept drift within time series and can explain the nonlinear relationships between predictions and previous time steps through symbolic regression, making it highly interpretable in dynamically changing environments. MT-KAN, on the other hand, improves predictive performance by effectively uncovering and leveraging the complex relationships among variables in multivariate time series. Experiments validate the effectiveness of these approaches, demonstrating that T-KAN and MT-KAN significantly outperform traditional methods in time series forecasting tasks, not only enhancing predictive accuracy but also improving model interpretability. This research opens new avenues for adaptive forecasting models, highlighting the potential of KAN as a powerful and interpretable tool in predictive analytics.

Exploring the Potential of Polynomial Basis Functions in Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks: A Comparative Study of Different Groups of Polynomials,"This paper presents a comprehensive survey of 18 distinct polynomials and their potential applications in Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) models as an alternative to traditional spline-based methods. The polynomials are classified into various groups based on their mathematical properties, such as orthogonal polynomials, hypergeometric polynomials, q-polynomials, Fibonacci-related polynomials, combinatorial polynomials, and number-theoretic polynomials.

We find that although the original KANs based on the B-splines parameterization lack accuracy and efficiency, modified versions based on low-order orthogonal polynomials have comparable performance to PINNs and DeepONet although they still lack robustness as they may diverge for different random seeds or higher order orthogonal polynomials. We visualize their corresponding loss landscapes and analyze their learning dynamics using information bottleneck theory. Our study follows the FAIR principles so that other researchers can use our benchmarks to further advance this emerging topic.

GKAN: Graph Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks,"We introduce Graph Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (GKAN), an innovative neural network architecture that extends the principles of the recently proposed Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) to graph-structured data. By adopting the unique characteristics of KANs, notably the use of learnable univariate functions instead of fixed linear weights, we develop a powerful model for graph-based learning tasks. Unlike traditional Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) that rely on a fixed convolutional architecture, GKANs implement learnable spline-based functions between layers, transforming the way information is processed across the graph structure. We present two different ways to incorporate KAN layers into GKAN: architecture 1 -- where the learnable functions are applied to input features after aggregation and architecture 2 -- where the learnable functions are applied to input features before aggregation. We evaluate GKAN empirically using a semi-supervised graph learning task on a real-world dataset (Cora). We find that architecture generally performs better. We find that GKANs achieve higher accuracy in semi-supervised learning tasks on graphs compared to the traditional GCN model. For example, when considering 100 features, GCN provides an accuracy of 53.5 while a GKAN with a comparable number of parameters gives an accuracy of 61.76; with 200 features, GCN provides an accuracy of 61.24 while a GKAN with a comparable number of parameters gives an accuracy of 67.66. We also present results on the impact of various parameters such as the number of hidden nodes, grid-size, and the polynomial-degree of the spline on the performance of GKAN.

Precision is tested on synthetic regression data, image classification, image denoising, and sentiment analysis. Additionally, the performance is measured on various differential equations, including ordinary, partial, and fractional delay differential equations. The results demonstrate that integrating fractional Jacobi functions into KANs significantly improves training speed and performance across diverse fields and applications.

Kolmogorov Arnold Informed neural network: A physics-informed deep learning framework for solving forward and inverse problems based on Kolmogorov Arnold Networks,"AI for partial differential equations (PDEs) has garnered significant attention, particularly with the emergence of Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). The recent advent of Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) indicates that there is potential to revisit and enhance the previously MLP-based PINNs. Compared to MLPs, KANs offer interpretability and require fewer parameters. PDEs can be described in various forms, such as strong form, energy form, and inverse form. While mathematically equivalent, these forms are not computationally equivalent, making the exploration of different PDE formulations significant in computational physics. Thus, we propose different PDE forms based on KAN instead of MLP, termed Kolmogorov-Arnold-Informed Neural Network (KINN) for solving forward and inverse problems. We systematically compare MLP and KAN in various numerical examples of PDEs, including multi-scale, singularity, stress concentration, nonlinear hyperelasticity, heterogeneous, and complex geometry problems. Our results demonstrate that KINN significantly outperforms MLP regarding accuracy and convergence speed for numerous PDEs in computational solid mechanics, except for the complex geometry problem. This highlights KINN's potential for more efficient and accurate PDE solutions in AI for PDEs.

Realizability-Informed Machine Learning for Turbulence Anisotropy Mappings,"Within the context of machine learning-based closure mappings for RANS turbulence modelling, physical realizability is often enforced using ad-hoc postprocessing of the predicted anisotropy tensor. In this study, we address the realizability issue via a new physics-based loss function that penalizes non-realizable results during training, thereby embedding a preference for realizable predictions into the model. Additionally, we propose a new framework for data-driven turbulence modelling which retains the stability and conditioning of optimal eddy viscosity-based approaches while embedding equivariance. Several modifications to the tensor basis neural network to enhance training and testing stability are proposed. We demonstrate the conditioning, stability, and generalization of the new framework and model architecture on three flows: flow over a flat plate, flow over periodic hills, and flow through a square duct. The realizability-informed loss function is demonstrated to significantly increase the number of realizable predictions made by the model when generalizing to a new flow configuration. Altogether, the proposed framework enables the training of stable and equivariant anisotropy mappings, with more physically realizable predictions on new data. We make our code available for use and modification by others. Moreover, as part of this study, we explore the applicability of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) to turbulence modeling, assessing its potential to address non-linear mappings in the anisotropy tensor predictions and demonstrating promising results for the flat plate case.

Initial Investigation of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) as Feature Extractors for IMU Based Human Activity Recognition,"In this work, we explore the use of a novel neural network architecture, the Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) as feature extractors for sensor-based (specifically IMU) Human Activity Recognition (HAR). Where conventional networks perform a parameterized weighted sum of the inputs at each node and then feed the result into a statically defined nonlinearity, KANs perform non-linear computations represented by B-SPLINES on the edges leading to each node and then just sum up the inputs at the node. Instead of learning weights, the system learns the spline parameters. In the original work, such networks have been shown to be able to more efficiently and exactly learn sophisticated real valued functions e.g. in regression or PDE solution. We hypothesize that such an ability is also advantageous for computing low-level features for IMU-based HAR. To this end, we have implemented KAN as the feature extraction architecture for IMU-based human activity recognition tasks, including four architecture variations. We present an initial performance investigation of the KAN feature extractor on four public HAR datasets. It shows that the KAN-based feature extractor outperforms CNN-based extractors on all datasets while being more parameter efficient.

By replacing traditional fixed-weight kernels with learnable non-linear functions, Convolutional KANs offer a significant improvement in parameter efficiency and expressive power over standard Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). We empirically evaluate Convolutional KANs on the Fashion-MNIST dataset, demonstrating competitive accuracy with up to 50% fewer parameters compared to baseline classic convolutions. This suggests that the KAN Convolution can effectively capture complex spatial relationships with fewer resources, offering a promising alternative for parameter-efficient deep learning models.

We then evaluate rKAN's performance in various deep learning and physics-informed tasks to demonstrate its practicality and effectiveness in function approximation.

Demonstrating the Efficacy of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks in Vision Tasks,"In the realm of deep learning, the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) has emerged as a potential alternative to multilayer projections (MLPs). However, its applicability to vision tasks has not been extensively validated. In our study, we demonstrated the effectiveness of KAN for vision tasks through multiple trials on the MNIST, CIFAR10, and CIFAR100 datasets, using a training batch size of 32. Our results showed that while KAN outperformed the original MLP-Mixer on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100, it performed slightly worse than the state-of-the-art ResNet-18. These findings suggest that KAN holds significant promise for vision tasks, and further modifications could enhance its performance in future evaluations.Our contributions are threefold: first, we showcase the efficiency of KAN-based algorithms for visual tasks; second, we provide extensive empirical assessments across various vision benchmarks, comparing KAN's performance with MLP-Mixer, CNNs, and Vision Transformers (ViT); and third, we pioneer the use of natural KAN layers in visual tasks, addressing a gap in previous research.

How to Learn More? Exploring Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks for Hyperspectral Image Classification,"Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs) have shown excellent capability in complex hyperspectral image (HSI) classification. However, these models require a significant number of training data and are computational resources. On the other hand, modern Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) have demonstrated great classification capability. These modern MLP-based models require significantly less training data compared to CNNs and ViTs, achieving the state-of-the-art classification accuracy. Recently, Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) were proposed as viable alternatives for MLPs. Because of their internal similarity to splines and their external similarity to MLPs, KANs are able to optimize learned features with remarkable accuracy in addition to being able to learn new features. Thus, in this study, we assess the effectiveness of KANs for complex HSI data classification. Moreover, to enhance the HSI classification accuracy obtained by the KANs, we develop and propose a Hybrid architecture utilizing 1D, 2D, and 3D KANs. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed KAN architecture, we conducted extensive experiments on three newly created HSI benchmark datasets: QUH-Pingan, QUH-Tangdaowan, and QUH-Qingyun.

CEST-KAN: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks for CEST MRI Data Analysis,"Purpose: This study aims to propose and investigate the feasibility of using Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) for CEST MRI data analysis (CEST-KAN). Methods: CEST MRI data were acquired from twelve healthy volunteers at 3T. Data from ten subjects were used for training, while the remaining two were reserved for testing. The performance of multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and KAN models with the same network settings were evaluated and compared to the conventional multi-pool Lorentzian fitting (MPLF) method in generating water and multiple CEST contrasts, including amide, relayed nuclear Overhauser effect (rNOE), and magnetization transfer (MT). Results: The water and CEST maps generated by both MLP and KAN were visually comparable to the MPLF results. However, the KAN model demonstrated higher accuracy in extrapolating the CEST fitting metrics, as evidenced by the smaller validation loss during training and smaller absolute error during testing. Voxel-wise correlation analysis showed that all four CEST fitting metrics generated by KAN consistently exhibited higher Pearson coefficients than the MLP results, indicating superior performance. Moreover, the KAN models consistently outperformed the MLP models in varying hidden layer numbers despite longer training time. Conclusion: In this study, we demonstrated for the first time the feasibility of utilizing KAN for CEST MRI data analysis, highlighting its superiority over MLP in this task. The findings suggest that CEST-KAN has the potential to be a robust and reliable post-analysis tool for CEST MRI in clinical settings.

KANQAS: Kolmogorov-Arnold Network for Quantum Architecture Search,"Quantum architecture Search (QAS) is a promising direction for optimization and automated design of quantum circuits towards quantum advantage. Recent techniques in QAS emphasize Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)-based deep Q-networks. However, their interpretability remains challenging due to the large number of learnable parameters and the complexities involved in selecting appropriate activation functions. In this work, to overcome these challenges, we utilize the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) in the QAS algorithm, analyzing their efficiency in the task of quantum state preparation and quantum chemistry. In quantum state preparation, our results show that in a noiseless scenario, the probability of success is 2 to 5 times higher than MLPs. In noisy environments, KAN outperforms MLPs in fidelity when approximating these states, showcasing its robustness against noise. In tackling quantum chemistry problems, we enhance the recently proposed QAS algorithm by integrating curriculum reinforcement learning with a KAN structure. This facilitates a more efficient design of parameterized quantum circuits by reducing the number of required 2-qubit gates and circuit depth. Further investigation reveals that KAN requires a significantly smaller number of learnable parameters compared to MLPs; however, the average time of executing each episode for KAN is higher.

KAGNNs: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks meet Graph Learning,"In recent years, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become the de facto tool for learning node and graph representations. Most GNNs typically consist of a sequence of neighborhood aggregation (a.k.a., message-passing) layers, within which the representation of each node is updated based on those of its neighbors. The most expressive message-passing GNNs can be obtained through the use of the sum aggregator and of MLPs for feature transformation, thanks to their universal approximation capabilities. However, the limitations of MLPs recently motivated the introduction of another family of universal approximators, called Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) which rely on a different representation theorem. In this work, we compare the performance of KANs against that of MLPs on graph learning tasks. We implement three new KAN-based GNN layers, inspired respectively by the GCN, GAT and GIN layers. We evaluate two different implementations of KANs using two distinct base families of functions, namely B-splines and radial basis functions. We perform extensive experiments on node classification, link prediction, graph classification and graph regression datasets. Our results indicate that KANs are on-par with or better than MLPs on all tasks studied in this paper. We also show that the size and training speed of RBF-based KANs is only marginally higher than for MLPs, making them viable alternatives. Code available at https://github.com/RomanBresson/KAGNN.

SpectralKAN: Kolmogorov-Arnold Network for Hyperspectral Images Change Detection,"It has been verified that deep learning methods, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs), graph neural networks (GNNs), and transformers, can accurately extract features from hyperspectral images (HSIs). These algorithms perform exceptionally well on HSIs change detection (HSIs-CD). However, the downside of these impressive results is the enormous number of parameters, FLOPs, GPU memory, training and test times required. In this paper, we propose an spectral Kolmogorov-Arnold Network for HSIs-CD (SpectralKAN). SpectralKAN represent a multivariate continuous function with a composition of activation functions to extract HSIs feature and classification. These activation functions are b-spline functions with different parameters that can simulate various functions. In SpectralKAN, a KAN encoder is proposed to enhance computational efficiency for HSIs. And a spatial-spectral KAN encoder is introduced, where the spatial KAN encoder extracts spatial features and compresses the spatial dimensions from patch size to one. The spectral KAN encoder then extracts spectral features and classifies them into changed and unchanged categories. We use five HSIs-CD datasets to verify the effectiveness of SpectralKAN. Experimental verification has shown that SpectralKAN maintains high HSIs-CD accuracy while requiring fewer parameters, FLOPs, GPU memory, training and testing times, thereby increasing the efficiency of HSIs-CD.

"RPN: Reconciled Polynomial Network Towards Unifying PGMs, Kernel SVMs, MLP and KAN","In this paper, we will introduce a novel deep model named Reconciled Polynomial Network (RPN) for deep function learning. RPN has a very general architecture and can be used to build models with various complexities, capacities, and levels of completeness, which all contribute to the correctness of these models. As indicated in the subtitle, RPN can also serve as the backbone to unify different base models into one canonical representation. This includes non-deep models, like probabilistic graphical models (PGMs) - such as Bayesian network and Markov network - and kernel support vector machines (kernel SVMs), as well as deep models like the classic multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and the recent Kolmogorov-Arnold network (KAN).
  Technically, RPN proposes to disentangle the underlying function to be inferred into the inner product of a data expansion function and a parameter reconciliation function. Together with the remainder function, RPN accurately approximates the underlying functions that governs data distributions. The data expansion functions in RPN project data vectors from the input space to a high-dimensional intermediate space, specified by the expansion functions in definition. Meanwhile, RPN also introduces the parameter reconciliation functions to fabricate a small number of parameters into a higher-order parameter matrix to address the ``curse of dimensionality'' problem caused by the data expansions. Moreover, the remainder functions provide RPN with additional complementary information to reduce potential approximation errors. We conducted extensive empirical experiments on numerous benchmark datasets across multiple modalities, including continuous function datasets, discrete vision and language datasets, and classic tabular datasets, to investigate the effectiveness of RPN.

TCKAN:A Novel Integrated Network Model for Predicting Mortality Risk in Sepsis Patients,"Sepsis poses a major global health threat, accounting for millions of deaths annually and significant economic costs. Accurately predicting the risk of mortality in sepsis patients enables early identification, promotes the efficient allocation of medical resources, and facilitates timely interventions, thereby improving patient outcomes. Current methods typically utilize only one type of data--either constant, temporal, or ICD codes. This study introduces a novel approach, the Time-Constant Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (TCKAN), which uniquely integrates temporal data, constant data, and ICD codes within a single predictive model. Unlike existing methods that typically rely on one type of data, TCKAN leverages a multi-modal data integration strategy, resulting in superior predictive accuracy and robustness in identifying high-risk sepsis patients. Validated against the MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV datasets, TCKAN surpasses existing machine learning and deep learning methods in accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. Notably, TCKAN achieved AUCs of 87.76% and 88.07%, demonstrating superior capability in identifying high-risk patients. Additionally, TCKAN effectively combats the prevalent issue of data imbalance in clinical settings, improving the detection of patients at elevated risk of mortality and facilitating timely interventions. These results confirm the model's effectiveness and its potential to transform patient management and treatment optimization in clinical practice. Although the TCKAN model has already incorporated temporal, constant, and ICD code data, future research could include more diverse medical data types, such as imaging and laboratory test results, to achieve a more comprehensive data integration and further improve predictive accuracy.

Enhancing Long-Range Dependency with State Space Model and Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks for Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis,"Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) evaluates sentiments toward specific aspects of entities within the text. However, attention mechanisms and neural network models struggle with syntactic constraints. The quadratic complexity of attention mechanisms also limits their adoption for capturing long-range dependencies between aspect and opinion words in ABSA. This complexity can lead to the misinterpretation of irrelevant contextual words, restricting their effectiveness to short-range dependencies. To address the above problem, we present a novel approach to enhance long-range dependencies between aspect and opinion words in ABSA (MambaForGCN). This approach incorporates syntax-based Graph Convolutional Network (SynGCN) and MambaFormer (Mamba-Transformer) modules to encode input with dependency relations and semantic information. The Multihead Attention (MHA) and Selective State Space model (Mamba) blocks in the MambaFormer module serve as channels to enhance the model with short and long-range dependencies between aspect and opinion words. We also introduce the Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) gated fusion, an adaptive feature representation system that integrates SynGCN and MambaFormer and captures non-linear, complex dependencies. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate MambaForGCN's effectiveness, outperforming state-of-the-art (SOTA) baseline models.

DropKAN: Regularizing KANs by masking post-activations,"We propose DropKAN (Dropout Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks) a regularization method that prevents co-adaptation of activation function weights in Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs). DropKAN functions by embedding the drop mask directly within the KAN layer, randomly masking the outputs of some activations within the KANs' computation graph. We show that this simple procedure that require minimal coding effort has a regularizing effect and consistently lead to better generalization of KANs. We analyze the adaptation of the standard Dropout with KANs and demonstrate that Dropout applied to KANs' neurons can lead to unpredictable behavior in the feedforward pass. We carry an empirical study with real world Machine Learning datasets to validate our findings. Our results suggest that DropKAN is consistently a better alternative to using standard Dropout with KANs, and improves the generalization performance of KANs. Our implementation of DropKAN is available at: \url{https://github.com/Ghaith81/dropkan}.

Reduced Effectiveness of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks on Functions with Noise,"It has been observed that even a small amount of noise introduced into the dataset can significantly degrade the performance of KAN. In this brief note, we aim to quantitatively evaluate the performance when noise is added to the dataset. We propose an oversampling technique combined with denoising to alleviate the impact of noise. Specifically, we employ kernel filtering based on diffusion maps for pre-filtering the noisy data for training KAN network. Our experiments show that while adding i.i.d. noise with any fixed SNR, when we increase the amount of training data by a factor of $r$, the test-loss (RMSE) of KANs will exhibit a performance trend like $\text{test-loss} \sim \mathcal{O}(r^{-\frac{1}{2}})$ as $r\to +\infty$. We conclude that applying both oversampling and filtering strategies can reduce the detrimental effects of noise. Nevertheless, determining the optimal variance for the kernel filtering process is challenging, and enhancing the volume of training data substantially increases the associated costs, because the training dataset needs to be expanded multiple times in comparison to the initial clean data. As a result, the noise present in the data ultimately diminishes the effectiveness of Kolmogorov-Arnold networks.

Inferring turbulent velocity and temperature fields and their statistics from Lagrangian velocity measurements using physics-informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks,"We propose the Artificial Intelligence Velocimetry-Thermometry (AIVT) method to infer hidden temperature fields from experimental turbulent velocity data. This physics-informed machine learning method enables us to infer continuous temperature fields using only sparse velocity data, hence eliminating the need for direct temperature measurements. Specifically, AIVT is based on physics-informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (not neural networks) and is trained by optimizing a combined loss function that minimizes the residuals of the velocity data, boundary conditions, and the governing equations. We apply AIVT to a unique set of experimental volumetric and simultaneous temperature and velocity data of Rayleigh-Bénard convection (RBC) that we acquired by combining Particle Image Thermometry and Lagrangian Particle Tracking. This allows us to compare AIVT predictions and measurements directly. We demonstrate that we can reconstruct and infer continuous and instantaneous velocity and temperature fields from sparse experimental data at a fidelity comparable to direct numerical simulations (DNS) of turbulence. This, in turn, enables us to compute important quantities for quantifying turbulence, such as fluctuations, viscous and thermal dissipation, and QR distribution. This paradigm shift in processing experimental data using AIVT to infer turbulent fields at DNS-level fidelity is a promising avenue in breaking the current deadlock of quantitative understanding of turbulence at high Reynolds numbers, where DNS is computationally infeasible.

Sparks of Quantum Advantage and Rapid Retraining in Machine Learning,"The advent of quantum computing holds the potential to revolutionize various fields by solving complex problems more efficiently than classical computers. Despite this promise, practical quantum advantage is hindered by current hardware limitations, notably the small number of qubits and high noise levels. In this study, we leverage adiabatic quantum computers to optimize Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks, a powerful neural network architecture for representing complex functions with minimal parameters. By modifying the network to use Bezier curves as the basis functions and formulating the optimization problem into a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization problem, we create a fixed-sized solution space, independent of the number of training samples. This strategy allows for the optimization of an entire neural network in a single training iteration in which, due to order of operations, a majority of the processing is done using a collapsed version of the training dataset. This inherently creates extremely fast training speeds, which are validated experimentally, compared to classical optimizers including Adam, Stochastic Gradient Descent, Adaptive Gradient, and simulated annealing. Additionally, we introduce a novel rapid retraining capability, enabling the network to be retrained with new data without reprocessing old samples, thus enhancing learning efficiency in dynamic environments. Experiments on retraining demonstrate a hundred times speed up using adiabatic quantum computing based optimization compared to that of the gradient descent based optimizers, with theoretical models allowing this speed up to be much larger! Our findings suggest that with further advancements in quantum hardware and algorithm optimization, quantum-optimized machine learning models could have broad applications across various domains, with initial focus on rapid retraining.

The first 3D implementation of ConvKANs for medical imaging is presented, comparing their performance to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) across three open-source datasets. Isolated analyses assessed performance within individual datasets, using cross-validation techniques. Holdout analyses evaluated cross-dataset generalizability by training models on two datasets and testing on the third, mirroring real-world clinical scenarios. In isolated analyses, 2D ConvKANs achieved the highest AUC of 0.99 (95% CI: 0.98-0.99) on the PPMI dataset, outperforming 2D CNNs (AUC: 0.97, p = 0.0092). 3D models showed promise, with 3D CNN and 3D ConvKAN reaching an AUC of 0.85 on PPMI. In holdout analyses, 3D ConvKAN demonstrated superior generalization, achieving an AUC of 0.85 on early-stage PD data. GCNs underperformed in 2D but improved in 3D implementations. These findings highlight ConvKANs' potential for PD detection, emphasize the importance of 3D analysis in capturing subtle brain changes, and underscore cross-dataset generalization challenges.

Adaptive Training of Grid-Dependent Physics-Informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks,"Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a robust framework for solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) by approximating their solutions via neural networks and imposing physics-based constraints on the loss function. Traditionally, Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) have been the neural network of choice, with significant progress made in optimizing their training. Recently, Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) were introduced as a viable alternative, with the potential of offering better interpretability and efficiency while requiring fewer parameters. In this paper, we present a fast JAX-based implementation of grid-dependent Physics-Informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (PIKANs) for solving PDEs, achieving up to 84 times faster training times than the original KAN implementation. We propose an adaptive training scheme for PIKANs, introducing an adaptive state transition technique to avoid loss function peaks between grid extensions, and a methodology for designing PIKANs with alternative basis functions. Through comparative experiments, we demonstrate that the adaptive features significantly enhance solution accuracy, decreasing the L^2 error relative to the reference solution by up to 43.02%. For the studied PDEs, our methodology approaches or surpasses the results obtained from architectures that utilize up to 8.5 times more parameters, highlighting the potential of adaptive, grid-dependent PIKANs as a superior alternative in scientific and engineering applications.

By employing linear or cubic spline interpolations for these KAN functions, we show that the computational cost of evaluating ANN potentials and their derivatives is reduced.

Exploring the Limitations of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks in Classification: Insights to Software Training and Hardware Implementation,"Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), a novel type of neural network, have recently gained popularity and attention due to the ability to substitute multi-layer perceptions (MLPs) in artificial intelligence (AI) with higher accuracy and interoperability. However, KAN assessment is still limited and cannot provide an in-depth analysis of a specific domain. Furthermore, no study has been conducted on the implementation of KANs in hardware design, which would directly demonstrate whether KANs are truly superior to MLPs in practical applications. As a result, in this paper, we focus on verifying KANs for classification issues, which are a common but significant topic in AI using four different types of datasets. Furthermore, the corresponding hardware implementation is considered using the Vitis high-level synthesis (HLS) tool. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first article to implement hardware for KAN. The results indicate that KANs cannot achieve more accuracy than MLPs in high complex datasets while utilizing substantially higher hardware resources. Therefore, MLP remains an effective approach for achieving accuracy and efficiency in software and hardware implementation.

In this work, we implement the Physics-Informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Neural Networks (PIKAN) through efficient-KAN and WAV-KAN, which utilize the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem. PIKAN demonstrates superior performance compared to conventional deep neural networks, achieving the same level of accuracy with fewer layers and reduced computational overhead. We explore both B-spline and wavelet-based implementations of PIKAN and benchmark their performance across various ordinary and partial differential equations using unsupervised (data-free) and supervised (data-driven) techniques. For certain differential equations, the data-free approach suffices to find accurate solutions, while in more complex scenarios, the data-driven method enhances the PIKAN's ability to converge to the correct solution. We validate our results against numerical solutions and achieve $99 \%$ accuracy in most scenarios.

These GP neurons exhibit robust non-linear modelling capabilities while using few parameters and can be easily and fully integrated in a feed-forward network structure. They provide inherent uncertainty estimates to the model prediction and can be trained directly on the log-likelihood objective function, without needing variational lower bounds or approximations.

COEFF-KANs: A Paradigm to Address the Electrolyte Field with KANs,"To reduce the experimental validation workload for chemical researchers and accelerate the design and optimization of high-energy-density lithium metal batteries, we aim to leverage models to automatically predict Coulombic Efficiency (CE) based on the composition of liquid electrolytes. There are mainly two representative paradigms in existing methods: machine learning and deep learning. However, the former requires intelligent input feature selection and reliable computational methods, leading to error propagation from feature estimation to model prediction, while the latter (e.g. MultiModal-MoLFormer) faces challenges of poor predictive performance and overfitting due to limited diversity in augmented data. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel method COEFF (COlumbic EFficiency prediction via Fine-tuned models), which consists of two stages: pre-training a chemical general model and fine-tuning on downstream domain data. Firstly, we adopt the publicly available MoLFormer model to obtain feature vectors for each solvent and salt in the electrolyte. Then, we perform a weighted average of embeddings for each token across all molecules, with weights determined by the respective electrolyte component ratios. Finally, we input the obtained electrolyte features into a Multi-layer Perceptron or Kolmogorov-Arnold Network to predict CE. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that our method achieves SOTA for predicting CE compared to all baselines. Data and code used in this work will be made publicly available after the paper is published.

DKL-KAN: Scalable Deep Kernel Learning using Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks,"The need for scalable and expressive models in machine learning is paramount, particularly in applications requiring both structural depth and flexibility. Traditional deep learning methods, such as multilayer perceptrons (MLP), offer depth but lack ability to integrate structural characteristics of deep learning architectures with non-parametric flexibility of kernel methods. To address this, deep kernel learning (DKL) was introduced, where inputs to a base kernel are transformed using a deep learning architecture. These kernels can replace standard kernels, allowing both expressive power and scalability. The advent of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) has generated considerable attention and discussion among researchers in scientific domain. In this paper, we introduce a scalable deep kernel using KAN (DKL-KAN) as an effective alternative to DKL using MLP (DKL-MLP). Our approach involves simultaneously optimizing these kernel attributes using marginal likelihood within a Gaussian process framework. We analyze two variants of DKL-KAN for a fair comparison with DKL-MLP: one with same number of neurons and layers as DKL-MLP, and another with approximately same number of trainable parameters. To handle large datasets, we use kernel interpolation for scalable structured Gaussian processes (KISS-GP) for low-dimensional inputs and KISS-GP with product kernels for high-dimensional inputs. The efficacy of DKL-KAN is evaluated in terms of computational training time and test prediction accuracy across a wide range of applications. Additionally, the effectiveness of DKL-KAN is also examined in modeling discontinuities and accurately estimating prediction uncertainty. The results indicate that DKL-KAN outperforms DKL-MLP on datasets with a low number of observations. Conversely, DKL-MLP exhibits better scalability and higher test prediction accuracy on datasets with large number of observations.

Traditional deep learning models, on the other hand, frequently lack interpretability and omit to take prediction uncertainty into account two crucial components of clinical decision making. In order to produce explainable and uncertainty aware predictions, this study presents a novel framework called Bayesian Kolmogorov Arnold Networks (BKANs), which combines the expressive capacity of Kolmogorov Arnold Networks with Bayesian inference.

We study a typical binary event classification task in high-energy physics including high-level features and comment on the performance and interpretability of KANs in this context. Consistent with expectations, we find that the learned activation functions of a one-layer KAN resemble the univariate log-likelihood ratios of the respective input features. In deeper KANs, the activations in the first layer differ from those in the one-layer KAN, which indicates that the deeper KANs learn more complex representations of the data, a pattern commonly observed in other deep-learning architectures. We study KANs with different depths and widths and we compare them to multilayer perceptrons in terms of performance and number of trainable parameters. For the chosen classification task, we do not find that KANs are more parameter efficient. However, small KANs may offer advantages in terms of interpretability that come at the cost of only a moderate loss in performance.

However, the combination of KANs with point-cloud-based neural networks (e.g., PointNet) for computational physics has not yet been explored. To address this, we present Kolmogorov-Arnold PointNet (KA-PointNet) as a novel supervised deep learning framework for the prediction of incompressible steady-state fluid flow fields in irregular domains, where the predicted fields are a function of the geometry of the domains. In KA-PointNet, we implement shared KANs in the segmentation branch of the PointNet architecture. We utilize Jacobi polynomials to construct shared KANs. As a benchmark test case, we consider incompressible laminar steady-state flow over a cylinder, where the geometry of its cross-section varies over the data set. We investigate the performance of Jacobi polynomials with different degrees as well as special cases of Jacobi polynomials such as Legendre polynomials, Chebyshev polynomials of the first and second kinds, and Gegenbauer polynomials, in terms of the computational cost of training and accuracy of prediction of the test set. Additionally, we compare the performance of PointNet with shared KANs (i.e., KA-PointNet) and PointNet with shared MLPs. It is observed that when the number of trainable parameters is approximately equal, PointNet with shared KANs (i.e., KA-PointNet) outperforms PointNet with shared MLPs. Moreover, KA-PointNet predicts the pressure and velocity distributions along the surface of cylinders more accurately, resulting in more precise computations of lift and drag.

Kolmogorov-Arnold Network for Online Reinforcement Learning,"Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have shown potential as an alternative to Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) in neural networks, providing universal function approximation with fewer parameters and reduced memory usage. In this paper, we explore the use of KANs as function approximators within the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm. We evaluate this approach by comparing its performance to the original MLP-based PPO using the DeepMind Control Proprio Robotics benchmark.

Physics-Informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks for Power System Dynamics,"This paper presents, for the first time, a framework for Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) in power system applications. Inspired by the recently proposed KAN architecture, this paper proposes physics-informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (PIKANs), a novel KAN-based physics-informed neural network (PINN) tailored to efficiently and accurately learn dynamics within power systems. The PIKANs present a promising alternative to conventional Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) based PINNs, achieving superior accuracy in predicting power system dynamics while employing a smaller network size. Simulation results on a single-machine infinite bus system and a 4-bus 2- generator system underscore the accuracy of the PIKANs in predicting rotor angle and frequency with fewer learnable parameters than conventional PINNs. Furthermore, the simulation results demonstrate PIKANs capability to accurately identify uncertain inertia and damping coefficients. This work opens up a range of opportunities for the application of KANs in power systems, enabling efficient determination of grid dynamics and precise parameter identification.

KAN You See It? KANs and Sentinel for Effective and Explainable Crop Field Segmentation,"Segmentation of crop fields is essential for enhancing agricultural productivity, monitoring crop health, and promoting sustainable practices. Deep learning models adopted for this task must ensure accurate and reliable predictions to avoid economic losses and environmental impact. The newly proposed Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KANs) offer promising advancements in the performance of neural networks. This paper analyzes the integration of KAN layers into the U-Net architecture (U-KAN) to segment crop fields using Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1 satellite images and provides an analysis of the performance and explainability of these networks. Our findings indicate a 2\% improvement in IoU compared to the traditional full-convolutional U-Net model in fewer GFLOPs. Furthermore, gradient-based explanation techniques show that U-KAN predictions are highly plausible and that the network has a very high ability to focus on the boundaries of cultivated areas rather than on the areas themselves. The per-channel relevance analysis also reveals that some channels are irrelevant to this task.

Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) for Time Series Classification and Robust Analysis,"Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) has recently attracted significant attention as a promising alternative to traditional Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP). Despite their theoretical appeal, KAN require validation on large-scale benchmark datasets. Time series data, which has become increasingly prevalent in recent years, especially univariate time series are naturally suited for validating KAN. Therefore, we conducted a fair comparison among KAN, MLP, and mixed structures. The results indicate that KAN can achieve performance comparable to, or even slightly better than, MLP across 128 time series datasets. We also performed an ablation study on KAN, revealing that the output is primarily determined by the base component instead of b-spline function. Furthermore, we assessed the robustness of these models and found that KAN and the hybrid structure MLP\_KAN exhibit significant robustness advantages, attributed to their lower Lipschitz constants. This suggests that KAN and KAN layers hold strong potential to be robust models or to improve the adversarial robustness of other models.

KAN versus MLP on Irregular or Noisy Functions,"In this paper, we compare the performance of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) networks on irregular or noisy functions. We control the number of parameters and the size of the training samples to ensure a fair comparison. For clarity, we categorize the functions into six types: regular functions, continuous functions with local non-differentiable points, functions with jump discontinuities, functions with singularities, functions with coherent oscillations, and noisy functions. Our experimental results indicate that KAN does not always perform best. For some types of functions, MLP outperforms or performs comparably to KAN. Furthermore, increasing the size of training samples can improve performance to some extent. When noise is added to functions, the irregular features are often obscured by the noise, making it challenging for both MLP and KAN to extract these features effectively. We hope these experiments provide valuable insights for future neural network research and encourage further investigations to overcome these challenges.

The Dawn of KAN in Image-to-Image (I2I) Translation: Integrating Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks with GANs for Unpaired I2I Translation,"Image-to-Image translation in Generative Artificial Intelligence (Generative AI) has been a central focus of research, with applications spanning healthcare, remote sensing, physics, chemistry, photography, and more. Among the numerous methodologies, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) with contrastive learning have been particularly successful. This study aims to demonstrate that the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) can effectively replace the Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) method in generative AI, particularly in the subdomain of image-to-image translation, to achieve better generative quality. Our novel approach replaces the two-layer MLP with a two-layer KAN in the existing Contrastive Unpaired Image-to-Image Translation (CUT) model, developing the KAN-CUT model. This substitution favors the generation of more informative features in low-dimensional vector representations, which contrastive learning can utilize more effectively to produce high-quality images in the target domain. Extensive experiments, detailed in the results section, demonstrate the applicability of KAN in conjunction with contrastive learning and GANs in Generative AI, particularly for image-to-image translation. This work suggests that KAN could be a valuable component in the broader generative AI domain.

"A Conflicts-free, Speed-lossless KAN-based Reinforcement Learning Decision System for Interactive Driving in Roundabouts","Safety and efficiency are crucial for autonomous driving in roundabouts, especially in the context of mixed traffic where autonomous vehicles (AVs) and human-driven vehicles coexist. This paper introduces a learning-based algorithm tailored to foster safe and efficient driving behaviors across varying levels of traffic flows in roundabouts. The proposed algorithm employs a deep Q-learning network to effectively learn safe and efficient driving strategies in complex multi-vehicle roundabouts. Additionally, a KAN (Kolmogorov-Arnold network) enhances the AVs' ability to learn their surroundings robustly and precisely. An action inspector is integrated to replace dangerous actions to avoid collisions when the AV interacts with the environment, and a route planner is proposed to enhance the driving efficiency and safety of the AVs. Moreover, a model predictive control is adopted to ensure stability and precision of the driving actions. The results show that our proposed system consistently achieves safe and efficient driving whilst maintaining a stable training process, as evidenced by the smooth convergence of the reward function and the low variance in the training curves across various traffic flows. Compared to state-of-the-art benchmarks, the proposed algorithm achieves a lower number of collisions and reduced travel time to destination.

Activation Space Selectable Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks,"The multilayer perceptron (MLP), a fundamental paradigm in current artificial intelligence, is widely applied in fields such as computer vision and natural language processing. However, the recently proposed Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN), based on nonlinear additive connections, has been proven to achieve performance comparable to MLPs with significantly fewer parameters. Despite this potential, the use of a single activation function space results in reduced performance of KAN and related works across different tasks. To address this issue, we propose an activation space Selectable KAN (S-KAN). S-KAN employs an adaptive strategy to choose the possible activation mode for data at each feedforward KAN node. Our approach outperforms baseline methods in seven representative function fitting tasks and significantly surpasses MLP methods with the same level of parameters. Furthermore, we extend the structure of S-KAN and propose an activation space selectable Convolutional KAN (S-ConvKAN), which achieves leading results on four general image classification datasets. Our method mitigates the performance variability of the original KAN across different tasks and demonstrates through extensive experiments that feedforward KANs with selectable activations can achieve or even exceed the performance of MLP-based methods. This work contributes to the understanding of the data-centric design of new AI paradigms and provides a foundational reference for innovations in KAN-based network architectures.

Beyond KAN: Introducing KarSein for Adaptive High-Order Feature Interaction Modeling in CTR Prediction,"Modeling high-order feature interactions is crucial for click-through rate (CTR) prediction, and traditional approaches often predefine a maximum interaction order and rely on exhaustive enumeration of feature combinations up to this predefined order. This framework heavily relies on prior domain knowledge to define interaction scope and entails high computational costs from enumeration. Conventional CTR models face a trade-off between improving representation through complex high-order feature interactions and reducing computational inefficiencies associated with these processes. To address this dual challenge, this study introduces the Kolmogorov-Arnold Represented Sparse Efficient Interaction Network (KarSein). Drawing inspiration from the learnable activation mechanism in the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN), KarSein leverages this mechanism to adaptively transform low-order basic features into high-order feature interactions, offering a novel approach to feature interaction modeling. KarSein extends the capabilities of KAN by introducing a more efficient architecture that significantly reduces computational costs while accommodating two-dimensional embedding vectors as feature inputs. Furthermore, it overcomes the limitation of KAN's its inability to spontaneously capture multiplicative relationships among features.
  Extensive experiments highlight the superiority of KarSein, demonstrating its ability to surpass not only the vanilla implementation of KAN in CTR predictio but also other baseline methods. Remarkably, KarSein achieves exceptional predictive accuracy while maintaining a highly compact parameter size and minimal computational overhead. As the first attempt to apply KAN in the CTR domain, this work introduces KarSein as a novel solution for modeling complex feature interactions, underscoring its transformative potential in advancing CTR prediction task.

UKAN: Unbound Kolmogorov-Arnold Network Accompanied with Accelerated Library,"In this work, we present a GPU-accelerated library for the underlying components of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), along with an algorithm to eliminate bounded grids in KANs. The GPU-accelerated library reduces the computational complexity of Basis Spline (B-spline) evaluation by a factor of $\mathcal{O}$(grid size) compared to existing codes, enabling batch computation for large-scale learning. To overcome the limitations of traditional KANs, we introduce Unbounded KANs (UKANs), which eliminate the need for a bounded grid and a fixed number of B-spline coefficients. To do so, we replace the KAN parameters (B-spline coefficients) with a coefficient generator (CG) model. The inputs to the CG model are designed based on the idea of an infinite symmetric grid extending from negative infinity to positive infinity. The positional encoding of grid group, a sequential collection of B-spline grid indexes, is fed into the CG model, and coefficients are consumed by the efficient implementation (matrix representations) of B-spline functions to generate outputs. We perform several experiments on regression, classification, and generative tasks, which are promising. In particular, UKAN does not require data normalization or a bounded domain for evaluation. Additionally, our benchmarking results indicate the superior memory and computational efficiency of our library compared to existing codes.

GINN-KAN: Interpretability pipelining with applications in Physics Informed Neural Networks,"Neural networks are powerful function approximators, yet their ``black-box"" nature often renders them opaque and difficult to interpret. While many post-hoc explanation methods exist, they typically fail to capture the underlying reasoning processes of the networks. A truly interpretable neural network would be trained similarly to conventional models using techniques such as backpropagation, but additionally provide insights into the learned input-output relationships. In this work, we introduce the concept of interpretability pipelineing, to incorporate multiple interpretability techniques to outperform each individual technique. To this end, we first evaluate several architectures that promise such interpretability, with a particular focus on two recent models selected for their potential to incorporate interpretability into standard neural network architectures while still leveraging backpropagation: the Growing Interpretable Neural Network (GINN) and Kolmogorov Arnold Networks (KAN). We analyze the limitations and strengths of each and introduce a novel interpretable neural network GINN-KAN that synthesizes the advantages of both models. When tested on the Feynman symbolic regression benchmark datasets, GINN-KAN outperforms both GINN and KAN. To highlight the capabilities and the generalizability of this approach, we position GINN-KAN as an alternative to conventional black-box networks in Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs).

However, the optimization of UAV trajectories in unknown areas or areas without sufficient prior information, still faces challenges related to poor planning performance and low distributed execution. These challenges arise when UAVs rely solely on their own observation information and the information from other UAVs within their communicable range, without access to global information. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the Qedgix framework, which combines graph neural networks (GNNs) and the QMIX algorithm to achieve distributed optimization of the Age of Information (AoI) for users in unknown scenarios. The framework utilizes GNNs to extract information from UAVs, users within the observable range, and other UAVs within the communicable range, thereby enabling effective UAV trajectory planning. Due to the discretization and temporal features of AoI indicators, the Qedgix framework employs QMIX to optimize distributed partially observable Markov decision processes (Dec-POMDP) based on centralized training and distributed execution (CTDE) with respect to mean AoI values of users. By modeling the UAV network optimization problem in terms of AoI and applying the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, the Qedgix framework achieves efficient neural network training through parameter sharing based on permutation invariance. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly improves convergence speed while reducing the mean AoI values of users.

FC-KAN: Function Combinations in Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks,"In this paper, we introduce FC-KAN, a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) that leverages combinations of popular mathematical functions such as B-splines, wavelets, and radial basis functions on low-dimensional data through element-wise operations. We explore several methods for combining the outputs of these functions, including sum, element-wise product, the addition of sum and element-wise product, representations of quadratic and cubic functions, concatenation, linear transformation of the concatenated output, and others. In our experiments, we compare FC-KAN with a multi-layer perceptron network (MLP) and other existing KANs, such as BSRBF-KAN, EfficientKAN, FastKAN, and FasterKAN, on the MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets. Two variants of FC-KAN, which use a combination of outputs from B-splines and Difference of Gaussians (DoG) and from B-splines and linear transformations in the form of a quadratic function, outperformed overall other models on the average of 5 independent training runs. We expect that FC-KAN can leverage function combinations to design future KANs. Our repository is publicly available at: https://github.com/hoangthangta/FC_KAN.

Efficient prediction of potential energy surface and physical properties with Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks,"The application of machine learning methodologies for predicting properties within materials science has garnered significant attention. Among recent advancements, Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have emerged as a promising alternative to traditional Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). This study evaluates the impact of substituting MLPs with KANs within three established machine learning frameworks: Allegro, Neural Equivariant Interatomic Potentials (NequIP), and the Edge-Based Tensor Prediction Graph Neural Network (ETGNN). Our results demonstrate that the integration of KANs generally yields enhanced prediction accuracies. Specifically, replacing MLPs with KANs in the output blocks leads to notable improvements in accuracy and, in certain scenarios, also results in reduced training times. Furthermore, employing KANs exclusively in the output block facilitates faster inference and improved computational efficiency relative to utilizing KANs throughout the entire model. The selection of an optimal basis function for KANs is found to be contingent upon the particular problem at hand. Our results demonstrate the strong potential of KANs in enhancing machine learning potentials and material property predictions.

"CoxKAN: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks for Interpretable, High-Performance Survival Analysis","Survival analysis is a branch of statistics used for modeling the time until a specific event occurs and is widely used in medicine, engineering, finance, and many other fields. When choosing survival models, there is typically a trade-off between performance and interpretability, where the highest performance is achieved by black-box models based on deep learning. This is a major problem in fields such as medicine where practitioners are reluctant to blindly trust black-box models to make important patient decisions. Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) were recently proposed as an interpretable and accurate alternative to multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs). We introduce CoxKAN, a Cox proportional hazards Kolmogorov-Arnold Network for interpretable, high-performance survival analysis. We evaluate the proposed CoxKAN on 4 synthetic datasets and 9 real medical datasets. The synthetic experiments demonstrate that CoxKAN accurately recovers interpretable symbolic formulae for the hazard function, and effectively performs automatic feature selection. Evaluation on the 9 real datasets show that CoxKAN consistently outperforms the Cox proportional hazards model and achieves performance that is superior or comparable to that of tuned MLPs. Furthermore, we find that CoxKAN identifies complex interactions between predictor variables that would be extremely difficult to recognise using existing survival methods, and automatically finds symbolic formulae which uncover the precise effect of important biomarkers on patient risk.

CF-KAN: Kolmogorov-Arnold Network-based Collaborative Filtering to Mitigate Catastrophic Forgetting in Recommender Systems,"Collaborative filtering (CF) remains essential in recommender systems, leveraging user--item interactions to provide personalized recommendations. Meanwhile, a number of CF techniques have evolved into sophisticated model architectures based on multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs). However, MLPs often suffer from catastrophic forgetting, and thus lose previously acquired knowledge when new information is learned, particularly in dynamic environments requiring continual learning. To tackle this problem, we propose CF-KAN, a new CF method utilizing Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KANs). By learning nonlinear functions on the edge level, KANs are more robust to the catastrophic forgetting problem than MLPs. Built upon a KAN-based autoencoder, CF-KAN is designed in the sense of effectively capturing the intricacies of sparse user--item interactions and retaining information from previous data instances. Despite its simplicity, our extensive experiments demonstrate 1) CF-KAN's superiority over state-of-the-art methods in recommendation accuracy, 2) CF-KAN's resilience to catastrophic forgetting, underscoring its effectiveness in both static and dynamic recommendation scenarios, and 3) CF-KAN's edge-level interpretation facilitating the explainability of recommendations.

Self-Supervised State Space Model for Real-Time Traffic Accident Prediction Using eKAN Networks,"Accurate prediction of traffic accidents across different times and regions is vital for public safety. However, existing methods face two key challenges: 1) Generalization: Current models rely heavily on manually constructed multi-view structures, like POI distributions and road network densities, which are labor-intensive and difficult to scale across cities. 2) Real-Time Performance: While some methods improve accuracy with complex architectures, they often incur high computational costs, limiting their real-time applicability. To address these challenges, we propose SSL-eKamba, an efficient self-supervised framework for traffic accident prediction. To enhance generalization, we design two self-supervised auxiliary tasks that adaptively improve traffic pattern representation through spatiotemporal discrepancy awareness. For real-time performance, we introduce eKamba, an efficient model that redesigns the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) architecture. This involves using learnable univariate functions for input activation and applying a selective mechanism (Selective SSM) to capture multi-variate correlations, thereby improving computational efficiency.

HSR-KAN: Efficient Hyperspectral Image Super-Resolution via Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks,"Hyperspectral images (HSIs) have great potential in various visual tasks due to their rich spectral information. However, obtaining high-resolution hyperspectral images remains challenging due to limitations of physical imaging.

In this study, we attempt to leverage the ability of supervised learning methods, such as ANNs, KANs, and gradient-boosted decision trees, to approximate complex multivariate functions in order to calibrate option prices based on past market data. The motivation for using ANNs and KANs is the Universal Approximation Theorem and Kolmogorov-Arnold Representation Theorem, respectively. Specifically, we use S\&P 500 (SPX) and NASDAQ 100 (NDX) index options traded during 2015-2023 with times to maturity ranging from 15 days to over 4 years (OptionMetrics IvyDB US dataset). Black \& Scholes's (BS) PDE \cite{Black1973} model's performance in pricing the same options compared to real data is used as a benchmark. This model relies on strong assumptions, and it has been observed and discussed in the literature that real data does not match its predictions. Supervised learning methods are widely used as an alternative for calibrating option prices due to some of the limitations of this model. In our experiments, the BS model underperforms compared to all of the others. Also, the best TDNN model outperforms the best MLP model on all error metrics. We implement a simple self-attention mechanism to enhance the RNN models, significantly improving their performance. The best-performing model overall is the LSTM-GRU hybrid RNN model with attention.

Homomorphic encryption (HE) facilitates privacy-preserving inference for deep learning models, enabling resource-limited users to benefit from deep learning services while ensuring data security.

Additionally, we develop an efficient method for computing B-spline functions within the HE domain, leveraging techniques such as repeat packing, lazy combination, and comparison functions. We evaluate the effectiveness of our privacy-preserving KAN inference scheme on both symbolic formula evaluation and image classification. The experimental results show that our model achieves accuracy comparable to plaintext KANs across various datasets and outperforms plaintext MLPs. Additionally, on the CIFAR-10 dataset, our inference latency achieves over 7 times speedup compared to the naive method.

Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks in Low-Data Regimes: A Comparative Study with Multilayer Perceptrons,"Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) have long been a cornerstone in deep learning, known for their capacity to model complex relationships. Recently, Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have emerged as a compelling alternative, utilizing highly flexible learnable activation functions directly on network edges, a departure from the neuron-centric approach of MLPs. However, KANs significantly increase the number of learnable parameters, raising concerns about their effectiveness in data-scarce environments.

Using empirical evaluations on simulated data and two real-world data sets from medicine and engineering, we explore the trade-offs between model complexity and accuracy, with particular attention to the role of network depth. Our findings show that MLPs with individualized activation functions achieve significantly higher predictive accuracy with only a modest increase in parameters, especially when the sample size is limited to around one hundred. For example, in a three-class classification problem within additive manufacturing, MLPs achieve a median accuracy of 0.91, significantly outperforming KANs, which only reach a median accuracy of 0.53 with default hyperparameters.

Kolmogorov-Arnold Transformer,"Transformers stand as the cornerstone of mordern deep learning. Traditionally, these models rely on multi-layer perceptron (MLP) layers to mix the information between channels. In this paper, we introduce the Kolmogorov-Arnold Transformer (KAT), a novel architecture that replaces MLP layers with Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) layers to enhance the expressiveness and performance of the model. Integrating KANs into transformers, however, is no easy feat, especially when scaled up. Specifically, we identify three key challenges: (C1) Base function. The standard B-spline function used in KANs is not optimized for parallel computing on modern hardware, resulting in slower inference speeds. (C2) Parameter and Computation Inefficiency. KAN requires a unique function for each input-output pair, making the computation extremely large. (C3) Weight initialization. The initialization of weights in KANs is particularly challenging due to their learnable activation functions, which are critical for achieving convergence in deep neural networks. To overcome the aforementioned challenges, we propose three key solutions: (S1) Rational basis. We replace B-spline functions with rational functions to improve compatibility with modern GPUs. By implementing this in CUDA, we achieve faster computations. (S2) Group KAN. We share the activation weights through a group of neurons, to reduce the computational load without sacrificing performance. (S3) Variance-preserving initialization. We carefully initialize the activation weights to make sure that the activation variance is maintained across layers. With these designs, KAT scales effectively and readily outperforms traditional MLP-based transformers.

Despite these advancements, their interpretability remains a critical challenge, especially in applications where transparency and accountability are essential. To address this, explainable AI (XAI) has made progress in demystifying ANNs, yet interpretability alone is often insufficient. In certain applications, model predictions must align with expert-imposed requirements, sometimes exemplified by partial monotonicity constraints. While monotonic approaches are found in the literature for traditional Multi-layer Perceptrons (MLPs), they still face difficulties in achieving both interpretability and certified partial monotonicity.

Building on this, we introduce a novel ANN architecture called MonoKAN, which is based on the KAN architecture and achieves certified partial monotonicity while enhancing interpretability. To achieve this, we employ cubic Hermite splines, which guarantee monotonicity through a set of straightforward conditions. Additionally, by using positive weights in the linear combinations of these splines, we ensure that the network preserves the monotonic relationships between input and output.

The proposed algorithm-level techniques include Alignment-Symmetry and PowerGap KAN hardware aware quantization, KAN sparsity aware mapping strategy, and circuit-level techniques include N:1 Time Modulation Dynamic Voltage input generator with analog-CIM (ACIM) circuits. The impact of non-ideal effects, such as partial sum errors caused by the process variations, has been evaluated with the statistics measured from the TSMC 22nm RRAM-ACIM prototype chips. With the best searched hyperparameters of KAN and the optimized circuits implemented in 22 nm node, we can reduce hardware area by 41.78x, energy by 77.97x with 3.03% accuracy boost compared to the traditional DNN hardware.

ASPINN: An asymptotic strategy for solving singularly perturbed differential equations,"Solving Singularly Perturbed Differential Equations (SPDEs) presents challenges due to the rapid change of their solutions at the boundary layer. In this manuscript, We propose Asymptotic Physics-Informed Neural Networks (ASPINN), a generalization of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN) and General-Kindred Physics-Informed Neural Networks (GKPINN) approaches. This is a decomposition method based on the idea of asymptotic analysis. Compared to PINN, the ASPINN method has a strong fitting ability for solving SPDEs due to the placement of exponential layers at the boundary layer. Unlike GKPINN, ASPINN lessens the number of fully connected layers, thereby reducing the training cost more effectively. Moreover, ASPINN theoretically approximates the solution at the boundary layer more accurately, which accuracy is also improved compared to GKPINN. We demonstrate the effect of ASPINN by solving diverse classes of SPDEs, which clearly shows that the ASPINN method is promising in boundary layer problems. Furthermore, we introduce Chebyshev Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (Chebyshev-KAN) instead of MLP, achieving better performance in various experiments.

A preliminary study on continual learning in computer vision using Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks,"Deep learning has long been dominated by multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs), which have demonstrated superiority over other optimizable models in various domains. Recently, a new alternative to MLPs has emerged - Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN)- which are based on a fundamentally different mathematical framework. According to their authors, KANs address several major issues in MLPs, such as catastrophic forgetting in continual learning scenarios. However, this claim has only been supported by results from a regression task on a toy 1D dataset. In this paper, we extend the investigation by evaluating the performance of KANs in continual learning tasks within computer vision, specifically using the MNIST datasets. To this end, we conduct a structured analysis of the behavior of MLPs and two KAN-based models in a class-incremental learning scenario, ensuring that the architectures involved have the same number of trainable parameters. Our results demonstrate that an efficient version of KAN outperforms both traditional MLPs and the original KAN implementation. We further analyze the influence of hyperparameters in MLPs and KANs, as well as the impact of certain trainable parameters in KANs, such as bias and scale weights. Additionally, we provide a preliminary investigation of recent KAN-based convolutional networks and compare their performance with that of traditional convolutional neural networks.

"Higher-order-ReLU-KANs (HRKANs) for solving physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) more accurately, robustly and faster","Finding solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs) is an important and essential component in many scientific and engineering discoveries. One of the common approaches empowered by deep learning is Physics-informed Neural Networks (PINNs). Recently, a new type of fundamental neural network model, Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), has been proposed as a substitute of Multilayer Perceptions (MLPs), and possesses trainable activation functions. To enhance KANs in fitting accuracy, a modification of KANs, so called ReLU-KANs, using ""square of ReLU"" as the basis of its activation functions, has been suggested. In this work, we propose another basis of activation functions, namely, Higherorder-ReLU (HR), which is simpler than the basis of activation functions used in KANs, namely, Bsplines; allows efficient KAN matrix operations; and possesses smooth and non-zero higher-order derivatives, essential to physicsinformed neural networks. We name such KANs with Higher-order-ReLU (HR) as their activations, HRKANs. Our detailed experiments on two famous and representative PDEs, namely, the linear Poisson equation and nonlinear Burgers' equation with viscosity, reveal that our proposed Higher-order-ReLU-KANs (HRKANs) achieve the highest fitting accuracy and training robustness and lowest training time significantly among KANs, ReLU-KANs and HRKANs. The codes to replicate our experiments are available at https://github.com/kelvinhkcs/HRKAN.

Our results show that GRKAN exhibits superior performance compared to standard Gating Residual Networks, particularly in LSTM-based models for sequential tasks. We also provide insights into the trade-offs between model complexity and performance gains in MoE and KAMoE architectures.

Data-driven model discovery with Kolmogorov-Arnold networks,"Data-driven model discovery of complex dynamical systems is typically done using sparse optimization, but it has a fundamental limitation: sparsity in that the underlying governing equations of the system contain only a small number of elementary mathematical terms. Examples where sparse optimization fails abound, such as the classic Ikeda or optical-cavity map in nonlinear dynamics and a large variety of ecosystems. Exploiting the recently articulated Kolmogorov-Arnold networks, we develop a general model-discovery framework for any dynamical systems including those that do not satisfy the sparsity condition. In particular, we demonstrate non-uniqueness in that a large number of approximate models of the system can be found which generate the same invariant set with the correct statistics such as the Lyapunov exponents and Kullback-Leibler divergence. An analogy to shadowing of numerical trajectories in chaotic systems is pointed out.

PPLNs: Parametric Piecewise Linear Networks for Event-Based Temporal Modeling and Beyond,"We present Parametric Piecewise Linear Networks (PPLNs) for temporal vision inference. Motivated by the neuromorphic principles that regulate biological neural behaviors, PPLNs are ideal for processing data captured by event cameras, which are built to simulate neural activities in the human retina. We discuss how to represent the membrane potential of an artificial neuron by a parametric piecewise linear function with learnable coefficients. This design echoes the idea of building deep models from learnable parametric functions recently popularized by Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs). Experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of PPLNs in event-based and image-based vision applications, including steering prediction, human pose estimation, and motion deblurring.

KANOP: A Data-Efficient Option Pricing Model using Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks,"Inspired by the recently proposed Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), we introduce the KAN-based Option Pricing (KANOP) model to value American-style options, building on the conventional Least Square Monte Carlo (LSMC) algorithm. KANs, which are based on Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, offer a data-efficient alternative to traditional Multi-Layer Perceptrons, requiring fewer hidden layers to achieve a higher level of performance. By leveraging the flexibility of KANs, KANOP provides a learnable alternative to the conventional set of basis functions used in the LSMC model, allowing the model to adapt to the pricing task and effectively estimate the expected continuation value. Using examples of standard American and Asian-American options, we demonstrate that KANOP produces more reliable option value estimates, both for single-dimensional cases and in more complex scenarios involving multiple input variables. The delta estimated by the KANOP model is also more accurate than that obtained using conventional basis functions, which is crucial for effective option hedging. Graphical illustrations further validate KANOP's ability to accurately model the expected continuation value for American-style options.

Incorporating Arbitrary Matrix Group Equivariance into KANs,"Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have seen great success in scientific domains thanks to spline activation functions, becoming an alternative to Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). However, spline functions may not respect symmetry in tasks, which is crucial prior knowledge in machine learning. In this paper, we propose Equivariant Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (EKAN), a method for incorporating arbitrary matrix group equivariance into KANs, aiming to broaden their applicability to more fields. We first construct gated spline basis functions, which form the EKAN layer together with equivariant linear weights, and then define a lift layer to align the input space of EKAN with the feature space of the dataset, thereby building the entire EKAN architecture. Compared with baseline models, EKAN achieves higher accuracy with smaller datasets or fewer parameters on symmetry-related tasks, such as particle scattering and the three-body problem, often reducing test MSE by several orders of magnitude. Even in non-symbolic formula scenarios, such as top quark tagging with three jet constituents, EKAN achieves comparable results with state-of-the-art equivariant architectures using fewer than 40% of the parameters, while KANs do not outperform MLPs as expected.

Uncertainty Quantification with Bayesian Higher Order ReLU KANs,"We introduce the first method of uncertainty quantification in the domain of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks, specifically focusing on (Higher Order) ReLUKANs to enhance computational efficiency given the computational demands of Bayesian methods.

Referring to the latter, we demonstrate the method's ability to correctly identify functional dependencies introduced through the inclusion of a stochastic term.

On the expressiveness and spectral bias of KANs,"Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) \cite{liu2024kan} were very recently proposed as a potential alternative to the prevalent architectural backbone of many deep learning models, the multi-layer perceptron (MLP). KANs have seen success in various tasks of AI for science, with their empirical efficiency and accuracy demostrated in function regression, PDE solving, and many more scientific problems.
  In this article, we revisit the comparison of KANs and MLPs, with emphasis on a theoretical perspective. On the one hand, we compare the representation and approximation capabilities of KANs and MLPs. We establish that MLPs can be represented using KANs of a comparable size. This shows that the approximation and representation capabilities of KANs are at least as good as MLPs. Conversely, we show that KANs can be represented using MLPs, but that in this representation the number of parameters increases by a factor of the KAN grid size. This suggests that KANs with a large grid size may be more efficient than MLPs at approximating certain functions. On the other hand, from the perspective of learning and optimization, we study the spectral bias of KANs compared with MLPs. We demonstrate that KANs are less biased toward low frequencies than MLPs. We highlight that the multi-level learning feature specific to KANs, i.e. grid extension of splines, improves the learning process for high-frequency components. Detailed comparisons with different choices of depth, width, and grid sizes of KANs are made, shedding some light on how to choose the hyperparameters in practice.

Deep Learning Alternatives of the Kolmogorov Superposition Theorem,"This paper explores alternative formulations of the Kolmogorov Superposition Theorem (KST) as a foundation for neural network design. The original KST formulation, while mathematically elegant, presents practical challenges due to its limited insight into the structure of inner and outer functions and the large number of unknown variables it introduces. Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) leverage KST for function approximation, but they have faced scrutiny due to mixed results compared to traditional multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) and practical limitations imposed by the original KST formulation. To address these issues, we introduce ActNet, a scalable deep learning model that builds on the KST and overcomes many of the drawbacks of Kolmogorov's original formulation. We evaluate ActNet in the context of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), a framework well-suited for leveraging KST's strengths in low-dimensional function approximation, particularly for simulating partial differential equations (PDEs). In this challenging setting, where models must learn latent functions without direct measurements, ActNet consistently outperforms KANs across multiple benchmarks and is competitive against the current best MLP-based approaches. These results present ActNet as a promising new direction for KST-based deep learning applications, particularly in scientific computing and PDE simulation tasks.

MLP-KAN: Unifying Deep Representation and Function Learning,"Recent advancements in both representation learning and function learning have demonstrated substantial promise across diverse domains of artificial intelligence. However, the effective integration of these paradigms poses a significant challenge, particularly in cases where users must manually decide whether to apply a representation learning or function learning model based on dataset characteristics. To address this issue, we introduce MLP-KAN, a unified method designed to eliminate the need for manual model selection. By integrating Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) for representation learning and Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) for function learning within a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, MLP-KAN dynamically adapts to the specific characteristics of the task at hand, ensuring optimal performance.

QKAN: Quantum Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks,"The potential of learning models in quantum hardware remains an open question. Yet, the field of quantum machine learning persistently explores how these models can take advantage of quantum implementations. Recently, a new neural network architecture, called Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN), has emerged, inspired by the compositional structure of the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem. In this work, we design a quantum version of KAN called QKAN. Our QKAN exploits powerful quantum linear algebra tools, including quantum singular value transformation, to apply parameterized activation functions on the edges of the network. QKAN is based on block-encodings, making it inherently suitable for direct quantum input. Furthermore, we analyze its asymptotic complexity, building recursively from a single layer to an end-to-end neural architecture. The gate complexity of QKAN scales linearly with the cost of constructing block-encodings for input and weights, suggesting broad applicability in tasks with high-dimensional input. QKAN serves as a trainable quantum machine learning model by combining parameterized quantum circuits with established quantum subroutines. Lastly, we propose a multivariate state preparation strategy based on the construction of the QKAN architecture.

Art Forgery Detection using Kolmogorov Arnold and Convolutional Neural Networks,"Art authentication has historically established itself as a task requiring profound connoisseurship of one particular artist. Nevertheless, famous art forgers such as Wolfgang Beltracchi were able to deceive dozens of art experts. In recent years Artificial Intelligence algorithms have been successfully applied to various image processing tasks. In this work, we leverage the growing improvements in AI to present an art authentication framework for the identification of the forger Wolfgang Beltracchi. Differently from existing literature on AI-aided art authentication, we focus on a specialized model of a forger, rather than an artist, flipping the approach of traditional AI methods. We use a carefully compiled dataset of known artists forged by Beltracchi and a set of known works by the forger to train a multiclass image classification model based on EfficientNet. We compare the results with Kolmogorov Arnold Networks (KAN) which, to the best of our knowledge, have never been tested in the art domain. The results show a general agreement between the different models' predictions on artworks flagged as forgeries, which are then closely studied using visual analysis.

Standard convolutional operations are fundamentally limited by their linear nature along with fixed activations, where multiple layers are needed to learn complex patterns, making this approach computationally inefficient and prone to optimization difficulties. As a result, we introduce RKAN (Residual Kolmogorov-Arnold Network), which could be easily implemented into stages of traditional networks, such as ResNet. The module also integrates polynomial feature transformation that provides the expressive power of many convolutional layers through learnable, non-linear feature refinement. Our proposed RKAN module offers consistent improvements over the base models on various well-known benchmark datasets, such as CIFAR-100, Food-101, and ImageNet.

Classical machine learning models struggle with challenges such as high-dimensional data, class imbalances, poor feature representations, and lack of interpretability. While quantum machine learning holds promise, current hybrid models have not fully exploited quantum advantages. In this paper, we propose the Kolmogorov-Arnold Classical-Quantum Dual-Channel Neural Network (KACQ-DCNN), a novel hybrid architecture that replaces traditional multilayer perceptrons with Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), enabling learnable univariate activation functions. Our KACQ-DCNN 4-qubit, 1-layer model outperforms 37 benchmark models, including 16 classical and 12 quantum neural networks, achieving an accuracy of 92.03%, with macro-average precision, recall, and F1 scores of 92.00%. It also achieved a ROC-AUC of 94.77%, surpassing other models by significant margins, as validated by paired t-tests with a significance threshold of 0.0056 (after Bonferroni correction). Ablation studies highlight the synergistic effect of classical-quantum integration, improving performance by about 2% over MLP variants. Additionally, LIME and SHAP explainability techniques enhance feature interpretability, while conformal prediction provides robust uncertainty quantification. Our results demonstrate that KACQ-DCNN improves cardiovascular diagnostics by combining high accuracy with interpretability and uncertainty quantification.

Generalization Bounds and Model Complexity for Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks,"Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) is a network structure recently proposed by Liu et al. (2024) that offers improved interpretability and a more parsimonious design in many science-oriented tasks compared to multi-layer perceptrons. This work provides a rigorous theoretical analysis of KAN by establishing generalization bounds for KAN equipped with activation functions that are either represented by linear combinations of basis functions or lying in a low-rank Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS). In the first case, the generalization bound accommodates various choices of basis functions in forming the activation functions in each layer of KAN and is adapted to different operator norms at each layer. For a particular choice of operator norms, the bound scales with the $l_1$ norm of the coefficient matrices and the Lipschitz constants for the activation functions, and it has no dependence on combinatorial parameters (e.g., number of nodes) outside of logarithmic factors. Moreover, our result does not require the boundedness assumption on the loss function and, hence, is applicable to a general class of regression-type loss functions. In the low-rank case, the generalization bound scales polynomially with the underlying ranks as well as the Lipschitz constants of the activation functions in each layer. These bounds are empirically investigated for KANs trained with stochastic gradient descent on simulated and real data sets. The numerical results demonstrate the practical relevance of these bounds.

On the Convergence of (Stochastic) Gradient Descent for Kolmogorov--Arnold Networks,"Kolmogorov--Arnold Networks (KANs), a recently proposed neural network architecture, have gained significant attention in the deep learning community, due to their potential as a viable alternative to multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) and their broad applicability to various scientific tasks. Empirical investigations demonstrate that KANs optimized via stochastic gradient descent (SGD) are capable of achieving near-zero training loss in various machine learning (e.g., regression, classification, and time series forecasting, etc.) and scientific tasks (e.g., solving partial differential equations). In this paper, we provide a theoretical explanation for the empirical success by conducting a rigorous convergence analysis of gradient descent (GD) and SGD for two-layer KANs in solving both regression and physics-informed tasks. For regression problems, we establish using the neural tangent kernel perspective that GD achieves global linear convergence of the objective function when the hidden dimension of KANs is sufficiently large. We further extend these results to SGD, demonstrating a similar global convergence in expectation. Additionally, we analyze the global convergence of GD and SGD for physics-informed KANs, which unveils additional challenges due to the more complex loss structure. This is the first work establishing the global convergence guarantees for GD and SGD applied to optimize KANs and physics-informed KANs.

The Proof of Kolmogorov-Arnold May Illuminate Neural Network Learning,"Kolmogorov and Arnold, in answering Hilbert's 13th problem (in the context of continuous functions), laid the foundations for the modern theory of Neural Networks (NNs). Their proof divides the representation of a multivariate function into two steps: The first (non-linear) inter-layer map gives a universal embedding of the data manifold into a single hidden layer whose image is patterned in such a way that a subsequent dynamic can then be defined to solve for the second inter-layer map. I interpret this pattern as ""minor concentration"" of the almost everywhere defined Jacobians of the interlayer map. Minor concentration amounts to sparsity for higher exterior powers of the Jacobians. We present a conceptual argument for how such sparsity may set the stage for the emergence of successively higher order concepts in today's deep NNs and suggest two classes of experiments to test this hypothesis.

Kolmogorov-Arnold Neural Networks for High-Entropy Alloys Design,"A wide range of deep learning-based machine learning techniques are extensively applied to the design of high-entropy alloys (HEAs), yielding numerous valuable insights. Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) is a recently developed architecture that aims to improve both the accuracy and interpretability of input features. In this work, we explore three different datasets for HEA design and demonstrate the application of KAN for both classification and regression models. In the first example, we use a KAN classification model to predict the probability of single-phase formation in high-entropy carbide ceramics based on various properties such as mixing enthalpy and valence electron concentration. In the second example, we employ a KAN regression model to predict the yield strength and ultimate tensile strength of HEAs based on their chemical composition and process conditions including annealing time, cold rolling percentage, and homogenization temperature. The third example involves a KAN classification model to determine whether a certain composition is an HEA or non-HEA, followed by a KAN regressor model to predict the bulk modulus of the identified HEA, aiming to identify HEAs with high bulk modulus. In all three examples, KAN either outperform or match the performance in terms of accuracy such as F1 score for classification and Mean Square Error (MSE), and coefficient of determination (R2) for regression of the multilayer perceptron (MLP) by demonstrating the efficacy of KAN in handling both classification and regression tasks. We provide a promising direction for future research to explore advanced machine learning techniques, which lead to more accurate predictions and better interpretability of complex materials, ultimately accelerating the discovery and optimization of HEAs with desirable properties.

WormKAN: Are KAN Effective for Identifying and Tracking Concept Drift in Time Series?,"Dynamic concepts in time series are crucial for understanding complex systems such as financial markets, healthcare, and online activity logs. These concepts help reveal structures and behaviors in sequential data for better decision-making and forecasting. However, existing models often struggle to detect and track concept drift due to limitations in interpretability and adaptability. To address this challenge, inspired by the flexibility of the recent Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN), we propose WormKAN, a concept-aware KAN-based model to address concept drift in co-evolving time series. WormKAN consists of three key components: Patch Normalization, Temporal Representation Module, and Concept Dynamics. Patch normalization processes co-evolving time series into patches, treating them as fundamental modeling units to capture local dependencies while ensuring consistent scaling. The temporal representation module learns robust latent representations by leveraging a KAN-based autoencoder, complemented by a smoothness constraint, to uncover inter-patch correlations. Concept dynamics identifies and tracks dynamic transitions, revealing structural shifts in the time series through concept identification and drift detection. These transitions, akin to passing through a \textit{wormhole}, are identified by abrupt changes in the latent space.

PointNet with KAN versus PointNet with MLP for 3D Classification and Segmentation of Point Sets,"Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have recently gained attention as an alternative to traditional Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) in deep learning frameworks. KANs have been integrated into various deep learning architectures such as convolutional neural networks, graph neural networks, and transformers, with their performance evaluated. However, their effectiveness within point-cloud-based neural networks remains unexplored. To address this gap, we incorporate KANs into PointNet for the first time to evaluate their performance on 3D point cloud classification and segmentation tasks. Specifically, we introduce PointNet-KAN, built upon two key components. First, it employs KANs instead of traditional MLPs. Second, it retains the core principle of PointNet by using shared KAN layers and applying symmetric functions for global feature extraction, ensuring permutation invariance with respect to the input features. In traditional MLPs, the goal is to train the weights and biases with fixed activation functions; however, in KANs, the goal is to train the activation functions themselves. We use Jacobi polynomials to construct the KAN layers. We extensively and systematically evaluate PointNet-KAN across various polynomial degrees and special types such as the Lagrange, Chebyshev, and Gegenbauer polynomials. Our results show that PointNet-KAN achieves competitive performance compared to PointNet with MLPs on benchmark datasets for 3D object classification and segmentation, despite employing a shallower and simpler network architecture. We hope this work serves as a foundation and provides guidance for integrating KANs, as an alternative to MLPs, into more advanced point cloud processing architectures.

EPi-cKANs: Elasto-Plasticity Informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks Using Chebyshev Polynomials,"Multilayer perceptron (MLP) networks are predominantly used to develop data-driven constitutive models for granular materials. They offer a compelling alternative to traditional physics-based constitutive models in predicting nonlinear responses of these materials, e.g., elasto-plasticity, under various loading conditions. To attain the necessary accuracy, MLPs often need to be sufficiently deep or wide, owing to the curse of dimensionality inherent in these problems. To overcome this limitation, we present an elasto-plasticity informed Chebyshev-based Kolmogorov-Arnold network (EPi-cKAN) in this study. This architecture leverages the benefits of KANs and augmented Chebyshev polynomials, as well as integrates physical principles within both the network structure and the loss function. The primary objective of EPi-cKAN is to provide an accurate and generalizable function approximation for non-linear stress-strain relationships, using fewer parameters compared to standard MLPs. To evaluate the efficiency, accuracy, and generalization capabilities of EPi-cKAN in modeling complex elasto-plastic behavior, we initially compare its performance with other cKAN-based models, which include purely data-driven parallel and serial architectures. Furthermore, to differentiate EPi-cKAN's distinct performance, we also compare it against purely data-driven and physics-informed MLP-based methods. Lastly, we test EPi-cKAN's ability to predict blind strain-controlled paths that extend beyond the training data distribution to gauge its generalization and predictive capabilities. Our findings indicate that, even with limited data and fewer parameters compared to other approaches, EPi-cKAN provides superior accuracy in predicting stress components and demonstrates better generalization when used to predict sand elasto-plastic behavior under blind triaxial axisymmetric strain-controlled loading paths.

KA-GNN: Kolmogorov-Arnold Graph Neural Networks for Molecular Property Prediction,"As key models in geometric deep learning, graph neural networks have demonstrated enormous power in molecular data analysis. Recently, a specially-designed learning scheme, known as Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN), shows unique potential for the improvement of model accuracy, efficiency, and explainability. Here we propose the first non-trivial Kolmogorov-Arnold Network-based Graph Neural Networks (KA-GNNs), including KAN-based graph convolutional networks(KA-GCN) and KAN-based graph attention network (KA-GAT). The essential idea is to utilizes KAN's unique power to optimize GNN architectures at three major levels, including node embedding, message passing, and readout. Further, with the strong approximation capability of Fourier series, we develop Fourier series-based KAN model and provide a rigorous mathematical prove of the robust approximation capability of this Fourier KAN architecture. To validate our KA-GNNs, we consider seven most-widely-used benchmark datasets for molecular property prediction and extensively compare with existing state-of-the-art models. It has been found that our KA-GNNs can outperform traditional GNN models. More importantly, our Fourier KAN module can not only increase the model accuracy but also reduce the computational time. This work not only highlights the great power of KA-GNNs in molecular property prediction but also provides a novel geometric deep learning framework for the general non-Euclidean data analysis.

Baseflow identification via explainable AI with Kolmogorov-Arnold networks,"Hydrological models often involve constitutive laws that may not be optimal in every application. We propose to replace such laws with the Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KANs), a class of neural networks designed to identify symbolic expressions. We demonstrate KAN's potential on the problem of baseflow identification, a notoriously challenging task plagued by significant uncertainty. KAN-derived functional dependencies of the baseflow components on the aridity index outperform their original counterparts. On a test set, they increase the Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) by 67%, decrease the root mean squared error by 30%, and increase the Kling-Gupta efficiency by 24%. This superior performance is achieved while reducing the number of fitting parameters from three to two. Next, we use data from 378 catchments across the continental United States to refine the water-balance equation at the mean-annual scale. The KAN-derived equations based on the refined water balance outperform both the current aridity index model, with up to a 105% increase in NSE, and the KAN-derived equations based on the original water balance. While the performance of our model and tree-based machine learning methods is similar, KANs offer the advantage of simplicity and transparency and require no specific software or computational tools. This case study focuses on the aridity index formulation, but the approach is flexible and transferable to other hydrological processes.

From PINNs to PIKANs: Recent Advances in Physics-Informed Machine Learning,"Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a key tool in Scientific Machine Learning since their introduction in 2017, enabling the efficient solution of ordinary and partial differential equations using sparse measurements. Over the past few years, significant advancements have been made in the training and optimization of PINNs, covering aspects such as network architectures, adaptive refinement, domain decomposition, and the use of adaptive weights and activation functions. A notable recent development is the Physics-Informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (PIKANS), which leverage a representation model originally proposed by Kolmogorov in 1957, offering a promising alternative to traditional PINNs. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the latest advancements in PINNs, focusing on improvements in network design, feature expansion, optimization techniques, uncertainty quantification, and theoretical insights. We also survey key applications across a range of fields, including biomedicine, fluid and solid mechanics, geophysics, dynamical systems, heat transfer, chemical engineering, and beyond.

HiPPO-KAN: Efficient KAN Model for Time Series Analysis,"In this study, we introduces a parameter-efficient model that outperforms traditional models in time series forecasting, by integrating High-order Polynomial Projection (HiPPO) theory into the Kolmogorov-Arnold network (KAN) framework. This HiPPO-KAN model achieves superior performance on long sequence data without increasing parameter count. Experimental results demonstrate that HiPPO-KAN maintains a constant parameter count while varying window sizes and prediction horizons, in contrast to KAN, whose parameter count increases linearly with window size. Surprisingly, although the HiPPO-KAN model keeps a constant parameter count as increasing window size, it significantly outperforms KAN model at larger window sizes. These results indicate that HiPPO-KAN offers significant parameter efficiency and scalability advantages for time series forecasting. Additionally, we address the lagging problem commonly encountered in time series forecasting models, where predictions fail to promptly capture sudden changes in the data. We achieve this by modifying the loss function to compute the MSE directly on the coefficient vectors in the HiPPO domain. This adjustment effectively resolves the lagging problem, resulting in predictions that closely follow the actual time series data. By incorporating HiPPO theory into KAN, this study showcases an efficient approach for handling long sequences with improved predictive accuracy, offering practical contributions for applications in large-scale time series data.

LSS-SKAN: Efficient Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks based on Single-Parameterized Function,"The recently proposed Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) networks have attracted increasing attention due to their advantage of high visualizability compared to MLP. In this paper, based on a series of small-scale experiments, we proposed the Efficient KAN Expansion Principle (EKE Principle): allocating parameters to expand network scale, rather than employing more complex basis functions, leads to more efficient performance improvements in KANs. Based on this principle, we proposed a superior KAN termed SKAN, where the basis function utilizes only a single learnable parameter. We then evaluated various single-parameterized functions for constructing SKANs, with LShifted Softplus-based SKANs (LSS-SKANs) demonstrating superior accuracy. Subsequently, extensive experiments were performed, comparing LSS-SKAN with other KAN variants on the MNIST dataset. In the final accuracy tests, LSS-SKAN exhibited superior performance on the MNIST dataset compared to all tested pure KAN variants.

Kaninfradet3D:A Road-side Camera-LiDAR Fusion 3D Perception Model based on Nonlinear Feature Extraction and Intrinsic Correlation,"With the development of AI-assisted driving, numerous methods have emerged for ego-vehicle 3D perception tasks, but there has been limited research on roadside perception. With its ability to provide a global view and a broader sensing range, the roadside perspective is worth developing. LiDAR provides precise three-dimensional spatial information, while cameras offer semantic information. These two modalities are complementary in 3D detection. However, adding camera data does not increase accuracy in some studies since the information extraction and fusion procedure is not sufficiently reliable. Recently, Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have been proposed as replacements for MLPs, which are better suited for high-dimensional, complex data. Both the camera and the LiDAR provide high-dimensional information, and employing KANs should enhance the extraction of valuable features to produce better fusion outcomes. This paper proposes Kaninfradet3D, which optimizes the feature extraction and fusion modules. To extract features from complex high-dimensional data, the model's encoder and fuser modules were improved using KAN Layers. Cross-attention was applied to enhance feature fusion, and visual comparisons verified that camera features were more evenly integrated. This addressed the issue of camera features being abnormally concentrated, negatively impacting fusion. Compared to the benchmark, our approach shows improvements of +9.87 mAP and +10.64 mAP in the two viewpoints of the TUMTraf Intersection Dataset and an improvement of +1.40 mAP in the roadside end of the TUMTraf V2X Cooperative Perception Dataset. The results indicate that Kaninfradet3D can effectively fuse features, demonstrating the potential of applying KANs in roadside perception tasks.

KANICE: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks with Interactive Convolutional Elements,"We introduce KANICE (Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks with Interactive Convolutional Elements), a novel neural architecture that combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) principles. KANICE integrates Interactive Convolutional Blocks (ICBs) and KAN linear layers into a CNN framework. This leverages KANs' universal approximation capabilities and ICBs' adaptive feature learning. KANICE captures complex, non-linear data relationships while enabling dynamic, context-dependent feature extraction based on the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem. We evaluated KANICE on four datasets: MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, EMNIST, and SVHN, comparing it against standard CNNs, CNN-KAN hybrids, and ICB variants. KANICE consistently outperformed baseline models, achieving 99.35% accuracy on MNIST and 90.05% on the SVHN dataset.
  Furthermore, we introduce KANICE-mini, a compact variant designed for efficiency. A comprehensive ablation study demonstrates that KANICE-mini achieves comparable performance to KANICE with significantly fewer parameters. KANICE-mini reached 90.00% accuracy on SVHN with 2,337,828 parameters, compared to KANICE's 25,432,000.

NIDS Neural Networks Using Sliding Time Window Data Processing with Trainable Activations and its Generalization Capability,"This paper presents neural networks for network intrusion detection systems (NIDS), that operate on flow data preprocessed with a time window. It requires only eleven features which do not rely on deep packet inspection and can be found in most NIDS datasets and easily obtained from conventional flow collectors. The time window aggregates information with respect to hosts facilitating the identification of flow signatures that are missed by other aggregation methods. Several network architectures are studied and the use of Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN)-inspired trainable activation functions that help to achieve higher accuracy with simpler network structure is proposed. The reported training accuracy exceeds 99% for the proposed method with as little as twenty neural network input features. This work also studies the generalization capability of NIDS, a crucial aspect that has not been adequately addressed in the previous studies. The generalization experiments are conducted using CICIDS2017 dataset and a custom dataset collected as part of this study. It is shown that the performance metrics decline significantly when changing datasets, and the reduction in performance metrics can be attributed to the difference in signatures of the same type flows in different datasets, which in turn can be attributed to the differences between the underlying networks. It is shown that the generalization accuracy of some neural networks can be very unstable and sensitive to random initialization parameters, and neural networks with fewer parameters and well-tuned activations are more stable and achieve higher accuracy.

Using Structural Similarity and Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks for Anatomical Embedding of Cortical Folding Patterns,"The 3-hinge gyrus (3HG) is a newly defined folding pattern, which is the conjunction of gyri coming from three directions in cortical folding. Many studies demonstrated that 3HGs can be reliable nodes when constructing brain networks or connectome since they simultaneously possess commonality and individuality across different individual brains and populations. However, 3HGs are identified and validated within individual spaces, making it difficult to directly serve as the brain network nodes due to the absence of cross-subject correspondence. The 3HG correspondences represent the intrinsic regulation of brain organizational architecture, traditional image-based registration methods tend to fail because individual anatomical properties need to be fully respected. To address this challenge, we propose a novel self-supervised framework for anatomical feature embedding of the 3HGs to build the correspondences among different brains. The core component of this framework is to construct a structural similarity-enhanced multi-hop feature encoding strategy based on the recently developed Kolmogorov-Arnold network (KAN) for anatomical feature embedding. Extensive experiments suggest that our approach can effectively establish robust cross-subject correspondences when no one-to-one mapping exists.

KAN-AD: Time Series Anomaly Detection with Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks,"Time series anomaly detection (TSAD) underpins real-time monitoring in cloud services and web systems, allowing rapid identification of anomalies to prevent costly failures. Most TSAD methods driven by forecasting models tend to overfit by emphasizing minor fluctuations. Our analysis reveals that effective TSAD should focus on modeling ""normal"" behavior through smooth local patterns. To achieve this, we reformulate time series modeling as approximating the series with smooth univariate functions. The local smoothness of each univariate function ensures that the fitted time series remains resilient against local disturbances. However, a direct KAN implementation proves susceptible to these disturbances due to the inherently localized characteristics of B-spline functions. We thus propose KAN-AD, replacing B-splines with truncated Fourier expansions and introducing a novel lightweight learning mechanism that emphasizes global patterns while staying robust to local disturbances. On four popular TSAD benchmarks, KAN-AD achieves an average 15% improvement in detection accuracy (with peaks exceeding 27%) over state-of-the-art baselines. Remarkably, it requires fewer than 1,000 trainable parameters, resulting in a 50% faster inference speed compared to the original KAN, demonstrating the approach's efficiency and practical viability.

A KAN-based Interpretable Framework for Process-Informed Prediction of Global Warming Potential,"Accurate prediction of Global Warming Potential (GWP) is essential for assessing the environmental impact of chemical processes and materials. Traditional GWP prediction models rely predominantly on molecular structure, overlooking critical process-related information. In this study, we present an integrative GWP prediction model that combines molecular descriptors (MACCS keys and Mordred descriptors) with process information (process title, description, and location) to improve predictive accuracy and interpretability. Using a deep neural network (DNN) model, we achieved an R-squared of 86% on test data with Mordred descriptors, process location, and description information, representing a 25% improvement over the previous benchmark of 61%; XAI analysis further highlighted the significant role of process title embeddings in enhancing model predictions. To enhance interpretability, we employed a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) to derive a symbolic formula for GWP prediction, capturing key molecular and process features and providing a transparent, interpretable alternative to black-box models, enabling users to gain insights into the molecular and process factors influencing GWP. Error analysis showed that the model performs reliably in densely populated data ranges, with increased uncertainty for higher GWP values. This analysis allows users to manage prediction uncertainty effectively, supporting data-driven decision-making in chemical and process design. Our results suggest that integrating both molecular and process-level information in GWP prediction models yields substantial gains in accuracy and interpretability, offering a valuable tool for sustainability assessments. Future work may extend this approach to additional environmental impact categories and refine the model to further enhance its predictive reliability.

Human-in-the-Loop Feature Selection Using Interpretable Kolmogorov-Arnold Network-based Double Deep Q-Network,"Feature selection is critical for improving the performance and interpretability of machine learning models, particularly in high-dimensional spaces where complex feature interactions can reduce accuracy and increase computational demands. Existing approaches often rely on static feature subsets or manual intervention, limiting adaptability and scalability. However, dynamic, per-instance feature selection methods and model-specific interpretability in reinforcement learning remain underexplored. This study proposes a human-in-the-loop (HITL) feature selection framework integrated into a Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN) using a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN). Our novel approach leverages simulated human feedback and stochastic distribution-based sampling, specifically Beta, to iteratively refine feature subsets per data instance, improving flexibility in feature selection. The KAN-DDQN achieved notable test accuracies of 93% on MNIST and 83% on FashionMNIST, outperforming conventional MLP-DDQN models by up to 9%.

Comparatively, the models without feature selection achieved test accuracies of only 58% on MNIST and 64% on FashionMNIST, highlighting significant gains with our framework. Pruning and visualization further enhanced model transparency by elucidating decision pathways. These findings present a scalable, interpretable solution for feature selection that is suitable for applications requiring real-time, adaptive decision-making with minimal human oversight.

Early Prediction of Natural Gas Pipeline Leaks Using the MKTCN Model,"Natural gas pipeline leaks pose severe risks, leading to substantial economic losses and potential hazards to human safety. In this study, we develop an accurate model for the early prediction of pipeline leaks. To the best of our knowledge, unlike previous anomaly detection, this is the first application to use internal pipeline data for early prediction of leaks. The modeling process addresses two main challenges: long-term dependencies and sample imbalance. First, we introduce a dilated convolution-based prediction model to capture long-term dependencies, as dilated convolution expands the model's receptive field without added computational cost. Second, to mitigate sample imbalance, we propose the MKTCN model, which incorporates the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network as the fully connected layer in a dilated convolution model, enhancing network generalization. Finally, we validate the MKTCN model through extensive experiments on two real-world datasets. Results demonstrate that MKTCN outperforms in generalization and classification, particularly under severe data imbalance, and effectively predicts leaks up to 5000 seconds in advance.

While PINNs typically use multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) as their underlying architecture, recent advancements have explored alternative neural network structures. One such innovation is the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN), which has demonstrated benefits over traditional MLPs, including faster neural scaling and better interpretability. The application of KANs to physics-informed learning has led to the development of Physics-Informed KANs (PIKANs), enabling the use of KANs to solve PDEs. However, despite their advantages, KANs often suffer from slower training speeds, particularly in higher-dimensional problems where the number of collocation points grows exponentially with the dimensionality of the system. To address this challenge, we introduce Separable Physics-Informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (SPIKANs). This novel architecture applies the principle of separation of variables to PIKANs, decomposing the problem such that each dimension is handled by an individual KAN. This approach drastically reduces the computational complexity of training without sacrificing accuracy, facilitating their application to higher-dimensional PDEs. Through a series of benchmark problems, we demonstrate the effectiveness of SPIKANs, showcasing their superior scalability and performance compared to PIKANs and highlighting their potential for solving complex, high-dimensional PDEs in scientific computing.

Can KAN Work? Exploring the Potential of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks in Computer Vision,"Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks(KANs), as a theoretically efficient neural network architecture, have garnered attention for their potential in capturing complex patterns. However, their application in computer vision remains relatively unexplored. This study first analyzes the potential of KAN in computer vision tasks, evaluating the performance of KAN and its convolutional variants in image classification and semantic segmentation. The focus is placed on examining their characteristics across varying data scales and noise levels. Results indicate that while KAN exhibits stronger fitting capabilities, it is highly sensitive to noise, limiting its robustness. To address this challenge, we propose a smoothness regularization method and introduce a Segment Deactivation technique. Both approaches enhance KAN's stability and generalization, demonstrating its potential in handling complex visual data tasks.

EAPCR: A Universal Feature Extractor for Scientific Data without Explicit Feature Relation Patterns,"Conventional methods, including Decision Tree (DT)-based methods, have been effective in scientific tasks, such as non-image medical diagnostics, system anomaly detection, and inorganic catalysis efficiency prediction. However, most deep-learning techniques have struggled to surpass or even match this level of success as traditional machine-learning methods. The primary reason is that these applications involve multi-source, heterogeneous data where features lack explicit relationships. This contrasts with image data, where pixels exhibit spatial relationships; textual data, where words have sequential dependencies; and graph data, where nodes are connected through established associations. The absence of explicit Feature Relation Patterns (FRPs) presents a significant challenge for deep learning techniques in scientific applications that are not image, text, and graph-based. In this paper, we introduce EAPCR, a universal feature extractor designed for data without explicit FRPs. Tested across various scientific tasks, EAPCR consistently outperforms traditional methods and bridges the gap where deep learning models fall short. To further demonstrate its robustness, we synthesize a dataset without explicit FRPs. While Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) and feature extractors like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), and Transformers struggle, EAPCR excels, demonstrating its robustness and superior performance in scientific tasks without FRPs.

Hybrid deep additive neural networks,"Traditional neural networks (multi-layer perceptrons) have become an important tool in data science due to their success across a wide range of tasks. However, their performance is sometimes unsatisfactory, and they often require a large number of parameters, primarily due to their reliance on the linear combination structure. Meanwhile, additive regression has been a popular alternative to linear regression in statistics. In this work, we introduce novel deep neural networks that incorporate the idea of additive regression. Our neural networks share architectural similarities with Kolmogorov-Arnold networks but are based on simpler yet flexible activation and basis functions. Additionally, we introduce several hybrid neural networks that combine this architecture with that of traditional neural networks. We derive their universal approximation properties and demonstrate their effectiveness through simulation studies and a real-data application. The numerical results indicate that our neural networks generally achieve better performance than traditional neural networks while using fewer parameters.

Addressing this limitation typically requires vast amounts of data. In contrast, Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks have gained attention in the machine learning community for their bold claim of being unaffected by the curse of dimensionality. This paper explores the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem and the mathematical principles underlying Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks, which enable their scalability and high performance in high-dimensional spaces.

KAN/MultKAN with Physics-Informed Spline fitting (KAN-PISF) for ordinary/partial differential equation discovery of nonlinear dynamic systems,"Machine learning for scientific discovery is increasingly becoming popular because of its ability to extract and recognize the nonlinear characteristics from the data. The black-box nature of deep learning methods poses difficulties in interpreting the identified model. There is a dire need to interpret the machine learning models to develop a physical understanding of dynamic systems. An interpretable form of neural network called Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KAN) or Multiplicative KAN (MultKAN) offers critical features that help recognize the nonlinearities in the governing ordinary/partial differential equations (ODE/PDE) of various dynamic systems and find their equation structures. In this study, an equation discovery framework is proposed that includes i) sequentially regularized derivatives for denoising (SRDD) algorithm to denoise the measure data to obtain accurate derivatives, ii) KAN to identify the equation structure and suggest relevant nonlinear functions that are used to create a small overcomplete library of functions, and iii) physics-informed spline fitting (PISF) algorithm to filter the excess functions from the library and converge to the correct equation. The framework was tested on the forced Duffing oscillator, Van der Pol oscillator (stiff ODE), Burger's equation, and Bouc-Wen model (coupled ODE). The proposed method converged to the true equation for the first three systems. It provided an approximate model for the Bouc-Wen model that could acceptably capture the hysteresis response. Using KAN maintains low complexity, which helps the user interpret the results throughout the process and avoid the black-box-type nature of machine learning methods.

KAN-Mamba FusionNet: Redefining Medical Image Segmentation with Non-Linear Modeling,"Medical image segmentation is essential for applications like robotic surgeries, disease diagnosis, and treatment planning. Recently, various deep-learning models have been proposed to enhance medical image segmentation. One promising approach utilizes Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), which better capture non-linearity in input data. However, they are unable to effectively capture long-range dependencies, which are required to accurately segment complex medical images and, by that, improve diagnostic accuracy in clinical settings. Neural networks such as Mamba can handle long-range dependencies. However, they have a limited ability to accurately capture non-linearities in the images as compared to KANs. Thus, we propose a novel architecture, the KAN-Mamba FusionNet, which improves segmentation accuracy by effectively capturing the non-linearities from input and handling long-range dependencies with the newly proposed KAMBA block. We evaluated the proposed KAN-Mamba FusionNet on three distinct medical image segmentation datasets: BUSI, Kvasir-Seg, and GlaS - and found it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in IoU and F1 scores. Further, we examined the effects of various components and assessed their contributions to the overall model performance via ablation studies. The findings highlight the effectiveness of this methodology for reliable medical image segmentation, providing a unique approach to address intricate visual data issues in healthcare.

Contrast Similarity-Aware Dual-Pathway Mamba for Multivariate Time Series Node Classification,"Multivariate time series (MTS) data is generated through multiple sensors across various domains such as engineering application, health monitoring, and the internet of things, characterized by its temporal changes and high dimensional characteristics. Over the past few years, many studies have explored the long-range dependencies and similarities in MTS. However, long-range dependencies are difficult to model due to their temporal changes and high dimensionality makes it difficult to obtain similarities effectively and efficiently. Thus, to address these issues, we propose contrast similarity-aware dual-pathway Mamba for MTS node classification (CS-DPMamba). Firstly, to obtain the dynamic similarity of each sample, we initially use temporal contrast learning module to acquire MTS representations. And then we construct a similarity matrix between MTS representations using Fast Dynamic Time Warping (FastDTW). Secondly, we apply the DPMamba to consider the bidirectional nature of MTS, allowing us to better capture long-range and short-range dependencies within the data. Finally, we utilize the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network enhanced Graph Isomorphism Network to complete the information interaction in the matrix and MTS node classification task. By comprehensively considering the long-range dependencies and dynamic similarity features, we achieved precise MTS node classification. We conducted experiments on multiple University of East Anglia (UEA) MTS datasets, which encompass diverse application scenarios. Our results demonstrate the superiority of our method through both supervised and semi-supervised experiments on the MTS classification task.

Learnable Activation Functions in Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Solving Partial Differential Equations,"We investigate learnable activation functions in Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs): comparing traditional Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) with fixed and trainable activations against Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) that employ learnable basis functions. While PINNs effectively incorporate physical laws into the learning process, they suffer from convergence and spectral bias problems, which limit their applicability to problems with rapid oscillations or sharp transitions. In this work, we study various activation and basis functions across diverse PDEs, including oscillatory, nonlinear wave, mixed-physics, and fluid dynamics problems. Using empirical Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) analysis and Hessian eigenvalue decomposition, we assess convergence behavior, stability, and high-frequency approximation capacity. While KANs offer improved expressivity for capturing complex, high-frequency PDE solutions, they introduce new optimization challenges, especially in deeper networks. Our findings show that KANs face a curse of functional dimensionality, creating intractable optimization landscapes in deeper networks. Low spectral bias alone does not guarantee good performance; adaptive spectral bias approaches such as B-splines achieve optimal results by balancing global stability with local high-frequency resolution. Different PDE types require tailored strategies: smooth global activation functions excel for wave phenomena, while local adaptive activation functions suit problems with sharp transitions.

GrokFormer: Graph Fourier Kolmogorov-Arnold Transformers,"Graph Transformers (GTs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in graph representation learning over popular graph neural networks (GNNs). However, self--attention, the core module of GTs, preserves only low-frequency signals in graph features, leading to ineffectiveness in capturing other important signals like high-frequency ones. Some recent GT models help alleviate this issue, but their flexibility and expressiveness are still limited since the filters they learn are fixed on predefined graph spectrum or spectral order. To tackle this challenge, we propose a Graph Fourier Kolmogorov-Arnold Transformer (GrokFormer), a novel GT model that learns highly expressive spectral filters with adaptive graph spectrum and spectral order through a Fourier series modeling over learnable activation functions. We demonstrate theoretically and empirically that the proposed GrokFormer filter offers better expressiveness than other spectral methods.

However, existing methods face problems such as insufficient interpretability and transparency as well as limited performance when dealing with high-dimensional and nonlinear data. To address these issues, this paper introduces a method based on Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs). KANs is a new type of neural network architecture with learnable activation functions and no linear weights, which has potential advantages in handling complex multi-dimensional data. Specifically, this paper applies KANs to the field of individual credit risk prediction for the first time and constructs the Kolmogorov-Arnold Credit Default Predict (KACDP) model. Experiments show that the KACDP model outperforms mainstream credit default prediction models in performance metrics (ROC_AUC and F1 values). Meanwhile, through methods such as feature attribution scores and visualization of the model structure, the model's decision-making process and the importance of different features are clearly demonstrated, providing transparent and interpretable decision-making basis for financial institutions and meeting the industry's strict requirements for model interpretability.

KAN See Your Face,"With the advancement of face reconstruction (FR) systems, privacy-preserving face recognition (PPFR) has gained popularity for its secure face recognition, enhanced facial privacy protection, and robustness to various attacks. Besides, specific models and algorithms are proposed for face embedding protection by mapping embeddings to a secure space. However, there is a lack of studies on investigating and evaluating the possibility of extracting face images from embeddings of those systems, especially for PPFR.

Face embedding mapping (FEM) models are proposed to learn the distribution mapping relation between the embeddings from the initial domain and target domain. In comparison with Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP), we provide two variants, FEM-KAN and FEM-MLP, for efficient non-linear embedding-to-embedding mapping in order to reconstruct realistic face images from the corresponding face embedding. To verify our methods, we conduct extensive experiments with various PPFR and FR models. We also measure reconstructed face images with different metrics to evaluate the image quality.

To fill this gap, this experimental study aims to provide extended observations and insights into the strengths and limitations of KANs. We reveal that although KANs can perform well in specific vision tasks, they face significant challenges, including increased hyperparameter sensitivity and higher computational costs. These limitations suggest that KANs require architectural adaptations, such as integration with other architectures, to be practical for large-scale vision problems. This study focuses on empirical findings rather than proposing new methods, aiming to inform future research on optimizing KANs, in particular computer vision applications or alike.

Despite clinical value, existing works fail to effectively incorporate diagnostic information from multiple anatomical views and lack related clinical expertise essential for accurate and reliable diagnosis. To resolve these limitations, we propose a novel Multi-view perception Knowledge-enhanced Transformer (MvKeTR) to mimic the diagnostic workflow of clinicians. Just as radiologists first examine CT scans from multiple planes, a Multi-View Perception Aggregator (MVPA) with view-aware attention effectively synthesizes diagnostic information from multiple anatomical views. Then, inspired by how radiologists further refer to relevant clinical records to guide diagnostic decision-making, a Cross-Modal Knowledge Enhancer (CMKE) retrieves the most similar reports based on the query volume to incorporate domain knowledge into the diagnosis procedure.

We show that KANs, based on the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, serve effectively as priors in such settings, providing a robust approach to denoising. We prove that the KAN denoiser is Lipschitz continuous, ensuring stability and convergence in optimisation algorithms like PnP-ADMM, even in the context of single-shot learning. Additionally, we provide theoretical guarantees for KAN-PnP, demonstrating its convergence under key conditions: the convexity of the data fidelity term, Lipschitz continuity of the denoiser, and boundedness of the regularisation functional. These conditions are crucial for stable and reliable optimisation. Our experimental results show, on super-resolution and joint optimisation, that KAN-PnP outperforms exiting methods, delivering superior performance in single-shot learning with minimal data. The method exhibits strong convergence properties, achieving high accuracy with fewer iterations.

PowerMLP: An Efficient Version of KAN,"The Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) is a new network architecture known for its high accuracy in several tasks such as function fitting and PDE solving. The superior expressive capability of KAN arises from the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem and learnable spline functions. However, the computation of spline functions involves multiple iterations, which renders KAN significantly slower than MLP, thereby increasing the cost associated with model training and deployment. The authors of KAN have also noted that ``the biggest bottleneck of KANs lies in its slow training. KANs are usually 10x slower than MLPs, given the same number of parameters.'' To address this issue, we propose a novel MLP-type neural network PowerMLP that employs simpler non-iterative spline function representation, offering approximately the same training time as MLP while theoretically demonstrating stronger expressive power than KAN. Furthermore, we compare the FLOPs of KAN and PowerMLP, quantifying the faster computation speed of PowerMLP. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that PowerMLP generally achieves higher accuracy and a training speed about 40 times faster than KAN in various tasks.

Granger Causality Detection with Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks,"Discovering causal relationships in time series data is central in many scientific areas, ranging from economics to climate science. Granger causality is a powerful tool for causality detection. However, its original formulation is limited by its linear form and only recently nonlinear machine-learning generalizations have been introduced. This study contributes to the definition of neural Granger causality models by investigating the application of Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KANs) in Granger causality detection and comparing their capabilities against multilayer perceptrons (MLP). In this work, we develop a framework called Granger Causality KAN (GC-KAN) along with a tailored training approach designed specifically for Granger causality detection. We test this framework on both Vector Autoregressive (VAR) models and chaotic Lorenz-96 systems, analysing the ability of KANs to sparsify input features by identifying Granger causal relationships, providing a concise yet accurate model for Granger causality detection. Our findings show the potential of KANs to outperform MLPs in discerning interpretable Granger causal relationships, particularly for the ability of identifying sparse Granger causality patterns in high-dimensional settings, and more generally, the potential of AI in causality discovery for the dynamical laws in physical systems.

Scattering-Based Structural Inversion of Soft Materials via Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks,"Small-angle scattering (SAS) techniques are indispensable tools for probing the structure of soft materials. However, traditional analytical models often face limitations in structural inversion for complex systems, primarily due to the absence of closed-form expressions of scattering functions. To address these challenges, we present a machine learning framework based on the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) for directly extracting real-space structural information from scattering spectra in reciprocal space. This model-independent, data-driven approach provides a versatile solution for analyzing intricate configurations in soft matter. By applying the KAN to lyotropic lamellar phases and colloidal suspensions -- two representative soft matter systems -- we demonstrate its ability to accurately and efficiently resolve structural collectivity and complexity. Our findings highlight the transformative potential of machine learning in enhancing the quantitative analysis of soft materials, paving the way for robust structural inversion across diverse systems.

KKANs: Kurkova-Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks and Their Learning Dynamics,"Inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem and Kurkova's principle of using approximate representations, we propose the Kurkova-Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KKAN), a new two-block architecture that combines robust multi-layer perceptron (MLP) based inner functions with flexible linear combinations of basis functions as outer functions. We first prove that KKAN is a universal approximator, and then we demonstrate its versatility across scientific machine-learning applications, including function regression, physics-informed machine learning (PIML), and operator-learning frameworks. The benchmark results show that KKANs outperform MLPs and the original Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) in function approximation and operator learning tasks and achieve performance comparable to fully optimized MLPs for PIML. To better understand the behavior of the new representation models, we analyze their geometric complexity and learning dynamics using information bottleneck theory, identifying three universal learning stages, fitting, transition, and diffusion, across all types of architectures. We find a strong correlation between geometric complexity and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), with optimal generalization achieved during the diffusion stage. Additionally, we propose self-scaled residual-based attention weights to maintain high SNR dynamically, ensuring uniform convergence and prolonged learning.

From KAN to GR-KAN: Advancing Speech Enhancement with KAN-Based Methodology,"Deep neural network (DNN)-based speech enhancement (SE) usually uses conventional activation functions, which lack the expressiveness to capture complex multiscale structures needed for high-fidelity SE. Group-Rational KAN (GR-KAN), a variant of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN), retains KAN's expressiveness while improving scalability on complex tasks. We adapt GR-KAN to existing DNN-based SE by replacing dense layers with GR-KAN layers in the time-frequency (T-F) domain MP-SENet and adapting GR-KAN's activations into the 1D CNN layers in the time-domain Demucs. Results on Voicebank-DEMAND show that GR-KAN requires up to 4x fewer parameters while improving PESQ by up to 0.1. In contrast, KAN, facing scalability issues, outperforms MLP on a small-scale signal modeling task but fails to improve MP-SENet. We demonstrate the first successful use of KAN-based methods for consistent improvement in both time- and SoTA TF-domain SE, establishing GR-KAN as a promising alternative for SE.

Zero Shot Time Series Forecasting Using Kolmogorov Arnold Networks,"Accurate energy price forecasting is crucial for participants in day-ahead energy markets, as it significantly influences their decision-making processes. While machine learning-based approaches have shown promise in enhancing these forecasts, they often remain confined to the specific markets on which they are trained, thereby limiting their adaptability to new or unseen markets. In this paper, we introduce a cross-domain adaptation model designed to forecast energy prices by learning market-invariant representations across different markets during the training phase. We propose a doubly residual N-BEATS network with Kolmogorov Arnold networks at its core for time series forecasting. These networks, grounded in the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, offer a powerful way to approximate multivariate continuous functions. The cross domain adaptation model was generated with an adversarial framework. The model's effectiveness was tested in predicting day-ahead electricity prices in a zero shot fashion. In comparison with baseline models, our proposed framework shows promising results. By leveraging the Kolmogorov-Arnold networks, our model can potentially enhance its ability to capture complex patterns in energy price data, thus improving forecast accuracy across diverse market conditions. This addition not only enriches the model's representational capacity but also contributes to a more robust and flexible forecasting tool adaptable to various energy markets.

ProKAN: Progressive Stacking of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks for Efficient Liver Segmentation,"The growing need for accurate and efficient 3D identification of tumors, particularly in liver segmentation, has spurred considerable research into deep learning models. While many existing architectures offer strong performance, they often face challenges such as overfitting and excessive computational costs. An adjustable and flexible architecture that strikes a balance between time efficiency and model complexity remains an unmet requirement. In this paper, we introduce proKAN, a progressive stacking methodology for Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) designed to address these challenges. Unlike traditional architectures, proKAN dynamically adjusts its complexity by progressively adding KAN blocks during training, based on overfitting behavior. This approach allows the network to stop growing when overfitting is detected, preventing unnecessary computational overhead while maintaining high accuracy. Additionally, proKAN utilizes KAN's learnable activation functions modeled through B-splines, which provide enhanced flexibility in learning complex relationships in 3D medical data. Our proposed architecture achieves state-of-the-art performance in liver segmentation tasks, outperforming standard Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) and fixed KAN architectures. The dynamic nature of proKAN ensures efficient training times and high accuracy without the risk of overfitting. Furthermore, proKAN provides better interpretability by allowing insight into the decision-making process through its learnable coefficients. The experimental results demonstrate a significant improvement in accuracy, Dice score, and time efficiency, making proKAN a compelling solution for 3D medical image segmentation tasks.

Gamma-Ray Burst Light Curve Reconstruction: A Comparative Machine and Deep Learning Analysis,"Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs), observed at large redshifts, are probes of the evolution of the Universe and can be used as cosmological tools. To this end, we need tight (with small dispersion) correlations among key parameters. To reduce such a dispersion, we will mitigate gaps in light curves (LCs), including the plateau region, key to building the two-dimensional Dainotti relation between the end time of plateau emission (Ta) to its luminosity (La). We reconstruct LCs using nine models: Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Bi-Mamba, Fourier Transform, Gaussian Process-Random Forest Hybrid (GP-RF), Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM), Conditional GAN (CGAN), SARIMAX-based Kalman filter, Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), and Attention U-Net. These methods are compared to the Willingale model (W07) over a sample of 545 GRBs. MLP and Bi-Mamba outperform other methods, with MLP reducing the plateau parameter uncertainties by 25.9% for log Ta, 28.6% for log Fa, and 37.7% for α (the post-plateau slope in the W07 model), achieving the lowest 5-fold cross validation (CV) mean squared error (MSE) of 0.0275. Bi-Mamba achieved the lowest uncertainty of parameters, a 33.3% reduction in log Ta, a 33.6% reduction in log Fa and a 41.9% in α, but with a higher MSE of 0.130. Bi-Mamba brings the lowest outlier percentage for log Ta and log Fa (2.70%), while MLP carries α outliers to 0.900%. The other methods yield MSE values ranging from 0.0339 to 0.174. These improvements in parameter precision are needed to use GRBs as standard candles, investigate theoretical models, and predict GRB redshifts through machine learning.

Advancing Parkinson's Disease Progression Prediction: Comparing Long Short-Term Memory Networks and Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks,"Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a degenerative neurological disorder that impairs motor and non-motor functions, significantly reducing quality of life and increasing mortality risk. Early and accurate detection of PD progression is vital for effective management and improved patient outcomes. Current diagnostic methods, however, are often costly, time-consuming, and require specialized equipment and expertise. This work proposes an innovative approach to predicting PD progression using regression methods, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and Kolmogorov Arnold Networks (KAN). KAN, utilizing spline-parametrized univariate functions, allows for dynamic learning of activation patterns, unlike traditional linear models.
  The Movement Disorder Society-Sponsored Revision of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) is a comprehensive tool for evaluating PD symptoms and is commonly used to measure disease progression. Additionally, protein or peptide abnormalities are linked to PD onset and progression. Identifying these associations can aid in predicting disease progression and understanding molecular changes.
  Comparing multiple models, including LSTM and KAN, this study aims to identify the method that delivers the highest metrics. The analysis reveals that KAN, with its dynamic learning capabilities, outperforms other approaches in predicting PD progression. This research highlights the potential of AI and machine learning in healthcare, paving the way for advanced computational models to enhance clinical predictions and improve patient care and treatment strategies in PD management.

Predicting Crack Nucleation and Propagation in Brittle Materials Using Deep Operator Networks with Diverse Trunk Architectures,"Phase-field modeling reformulates fracture problems as energy minimization problems and enables a comprehensive characterization of the fracture process, including crack nucleation, propagation, merging, and branching, without relying on ad-hoc assumptions. However, the numerical solution of phase-field fracture problems is characterized by a high computational cost. To address this challenge, in this paper, we employ a deep neural operator (DeepONet) consisting of a branch network and a trunk network to solve brittle fracture problems. We explore three distinct approaches that vary in their trunk network configurations. In the first approach, we demonstrate the effectiveness of a two-step DeepONet, which results in a simplification of the learning task. In the second approach, we employ a physics-informed DeepONet, whereby the mathematical expression of the energy is integrated into the trunk network's loss to enforce physical consistency. The integration of physics also results in a substantially smaller data size needed for training. In the third approach, we replace the neural network in the trunk with a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network and train it without the physics loss. Using these methods, we model crack nucleation in a one-dimensional homogeneous bar under prescribed end displacements, as well as crack propagation and branching in single edge-notched specimens with varying notch lengths subjected to tensile and shear loading. We show that the networks predict the solution fields accurately, and the error in the predicted fields is localized near the crack.

EHCTNet: Enhanced Hybrid of CNN and Transformer Network for Remote Sensing Image Change Detection,"Remote sensing (RS) change detection incurs a high cost because of false negatives, which are more costly than false positives. Existing frameworks, struggling to improve the Precision metric to reduce the cost of false positive, still have limitations in focusing on the change of interest, which leads to missed detections and discontinuity issues. This work tackles these issues by enhancing feature learning capabilities and integrating the frequency components of feature information, with a strategy to incrementally boost the Recall value. We propose an enhanced hybrid of CNN and Transformer network (EHCTNet) for effectively mining the change information of interest. Firstly, a dual branch feature extraction module is used to extract the multi scale features of RS images. Secondly, the frequency component of these features is exploited by a refined module I. Thirdly, an enhanced token mining module based on the Kolmogorov Arnold Network is utilized to derive semantic information. Finally, the semantic change information's frequency component, beneficial for final detection, is mined from the refined module II. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of EHCTNet in comprehending complex changes of interest. The visualization outcomes show that EHCTNet detects more intact and continuous changed areas and perceives more accurate neighboring distinction than state of the art models.

LWFNet: Coherent Doppler Wind Lidar-Based Network for Wind Field Retrieval,"Accurate detection of wind fields within the troposphere is essential for atmospheric dynamics research and plays a crucial role in extreme weather forecasting. Coherent Doppler wind lidar (CDWL) is widely regarded as the most suitable technique for high spatial and temporal resolution wind field detection. However, since coherent detection relies heavily on the concentration of aerosol particles, which cause Mie scattering, the received backscattering lidar signal exhibits significantly low intensity at high altitudes. As a result, conventional methods, such as spectral centroid estimation, often fail to produce credible and accurate wind retrieval results in these regions. To address this issue, we propose LWFNet, the first Lidar-based Wind Field (WF) retrieval neural Network, built upon Transformer and the Kolmogorov-Arnold network. Our model is trained solely on targets derived from the traditional wind retrieval algorithm and utilizes radiosonde measurements as the ground truth for test results evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that LWFNet not only extends the maximum wind field detection range but also produces more accurate results, exhibiting a level of precision that surpasses the labeled targets. This phenomenon, which we refer to as super-accuracy, is explored by investigating the potential underlying factors that contribute to this intriguing occurrence. In addition, we compare the performance of LWFNet with other state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, highlighting its superior effectiveness and capability in high-resolution wind retrieval. LWFNet demonstrates remarkable performance in lidar-based wind field retrieval, setting a benchmark for future research and advancing the development of deep learning models in this domain.

Scaled-cPIKANs: Domain Scaling in Chebyshev-based Physics-informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks,"Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) are integral to modeling many scientific and engineering problems. Physics-informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as promising tools for solving PDEs by embedding governing equations into the neural network loss function. However, when dealing with PDEs characterized by strong oscillatory dynamics over large computational domains, PINNs based on Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) often exhibit poor convergence and reduced accuracy. To address these challenges, this paper introduces Scaled-cPIKAN, a physics-informed architecture rooted in Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs). Scaled-cPIKAN integrates Chebyshev polynomial representations with a domain scaling approach that transforms spatial variables in PDEs into the standardized domain \([-1,1]^d\), as intrinsically required by Chebyshev polynomials. By combining the flexibility of Chebyshev-based KANs (cKANs) with the physics-driven principles of PINNs, and the spatial domain transformation, Scaled-cPIKAN enables efficient representation of oscillatory dynamics across extended spatial domains while improving computational performance. We demonstrate Scaled-cPIKAN efficacy using four benchmark problems: the diffusion equation, the Helmholtz equation, the Allen-Cahn equation, as well as both forward and inverse formulations of the reaction-diffusion equation (with and without noisy data). Our results show that Scaled-cPIKAN significantly outperforms existing methods in all test cases. In particular, it achieves several orders of magnitude higher accuracy and faster convergence rate, making it a highly efficient tool for approximating PDE solutions that feature oscillatory behavior over large spatial domains.

Interpretable deep learning illuminates multiple structures fluorescence imaging: a path toward trustworthy artificial intelligence in microscopy,"Live-cell imaging of multiple subcellular structures is essential for understanding subcellular dynamics. However, the conventional multi-color sequential fluorescence microscopy suffers from significant imaging delays and limited number of subcellular structure separate labeling, resulting in substantial limitations for real-time live-cell research applications. Here, we present the Adaptive Explainable Multi-Structure Network (AEMS-Net), a deep-learning framework that enables simultaneous prediction of two subcellular structures from a single image. The model normalizes staining intensity and prioritizes critical image features by integrating attention mechanisms and brightness adaptation layers.

We demonstrate that AEMS-Net allows real-time recording of interactions between mitochondria and microtubules, requiring only half the conventional sequential-channel imaging procedures. Notably, this approach achieves over 30% improvement in imaging quality compared to traditional deep learning methods, establishing a new paradigm for long-term, interpretable live-cell imaging that advances the ability to explore subcellular dynamics.

Kolmogorov-Arnold Recurrent Network for Short Term Load Forecasting Across Diverse Consumers,"Load forecasting plays a crucial role in energy management, directly impacting grid stability, operational efficiency, cost reduction, and environmental sustainability. Traditional Vanilla Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) face issues such as vanishing and exploding gradients, whereas sophisticated RNNs such as LSTMs have shown considerable success in this domain. However, these models often struggle to accurately capture complex and sudden variations in energy consumption, and their applicability is typically limited to specific consumer types, such as offices or schools. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the Kolmogorov-Arnold Recurrent Network (KARN), a novel load forecasting approach that combines the flexibility of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks with RNN's temporal modeling capabilities. KARN utilizes learnable temporal spline functions and edge-based activations to better model non-linear relationships in load data, making it adaptable across a diverse range of consumer types. The proposed KARN model was rigorously evaluated on a variety of real-world datasets, including student residences, detached homes, a home with electric vehicle charging, a townhouse, and industrial buildings. Across all these consumer categories, KARN consistently outperformed traditional Vanilla RNNs, while it surpassed LSTM and Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) in six buildings. The results demonstrate KARN's superior accuracy and applicability, making it a promising tool for enhancing load forecasting in diverse energy management scenarios.

Kolmogorov-Arnold Network for Remote Sensing Image Semantic Segmentation,"Semantic segmentation plays a crucial role in remote sensing applications, where the accurate extraction and representation of features are essential for high-quality results. Despite the widespread use of encoder-decoder architectures, existing methods often struggle with fully utilizing the high-dimensional features extracted by the encoder and efficiently recovering detailed information during decoding. To address these problems, we propose a novel semantic segmentation network, namely DeepKANSeg, including two key innovations based on the emerging Kolmogorov Arnold Network (KAN). Notably, the advantage of KAN lies in its ability to decompose high-dimensional complex functions into univariate transformations, enabling efficient and flexible representation of intricate relationships in data. First, we introduce a KAN-based deep feature refinement module, namely DeepKAN to effectively capture complex spatial and rich semantic relationships from high-dimensional features. Second, we replace the traditional multi-layer perceptron (MLP) layers in the global-local combined decoder with KAN-based linear layers, namely GLKAN. This module enhances the decoder's ability to capture fine-grained details during decoding. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, experiments are conducted on two well-known fine-resolution remote sensing benchmark datasets, namely ISPRS Vaihingen and ISPRS Potsdam. The results demonstrate that the KAN-enhanced segmentation model achieves superior performance in terms of accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods. They highlight the potential of KANs as a powerful alternative to traditional architectures in semantic segmentation tasks. Moreover, the explicit univariate decomposition provides improved interpretability, which is particularly beneficial for applications requiring explainable learning in remote sensing.

Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks and Evolutionary Game Theory for More Personalized Cancer Treatment,"Personalized cancer treatment is revolutionizing oncology by leveraging precision medicine and advanced computational techniques to tailor therapies to individual patients. Despite its transformative potential, challenges such as limited generalizability, interpretability, and reproducibility of predictive models hinder its integration into clinical practice. Current methodologies often rely on black-box machine learning models, which, while accurate, lack the transparency needed for clinician trust and real-world application. This paper proposes the development of an innovative framework that bridges Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) and Evolutionary Game Theory (EGT) to address these limitations. Inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, KANs offer interpretable, edge-based neural architectures capable of modeling complex biological systems with unprecedented adaptability. Their integration into the EGT framework enables dynamic modeling of cancer progression and treatment responses. By combining KAN's computational precision with EGT's mechanistic insights, this hybrid approach promises to enhance predictive accuracy, scalability, and clinical usability.

Scalable Bayesian Physics-Informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks,"Uncertainty quantification (UQ) plays a pivotal role in scientific machine learning, especially when surrogate models are used to approximate complex systems. Although multilayer perceptions (MLPs) are commonly employed as surrogates, they often suffer from overfitting due to their large number of parameters. Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KANs) offer an alternative solution with fewer parameters. However, gradient-based inference methods, such as Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC), may result in computational inefficiency when applied to KANs, especially for large-scale datasets, due to the high cost of back-propagation. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach, combining the dropout Tikhonov ensemble Kalman inversion (DTEKI) with Chebyshev KANs. This gradient-free method effectively mitigates overfitting and enhances numerical stability. Additionally, we incorporate the active subspace method to reduce the parameter-space dimensionality, allowing us to improve the accuracy of predictions and obtain more reliable uncertainty estimates. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in various test cases, including scenarios with large datasets and high noise levels. Our results show that the new method achieves comparable or better accuracy, much higher efficiency as well as stability compared to HMC, in addition to scalability. Moreover, by leveraging the low-dimensional parameter subspace, our method preserves prediction accuracy while substantially reducing further the computational cost.

Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks for Time Series Granger Causality Inference,"We propose the Granger causality inference Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANGCI), a novel architecture that extends the recently proposed Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) to the domain of causal inference. By extracting base weights from KAN layers and incorporating the sparsity-inducing penalty and ridge regularization, KANGCI effectively infers the Granger causality from time series. Additionally, we propose an algorithm based on time-reversed Granger causality that automatically selects causal relationships with better inference performance from the original or time-reversed time series or integrates the results to mitigate spurious connectivities. Comprehensive experiments conducted on Lorenz-96, Gene regulatory networks, fMRI BOLD signals, VAR, and real-world EEG datasets demonstrate that the proposed model achieves competitive performance to state-of-the-art methods in inferring Granger causality from nonlinear, high-dimensional, and limited-sample time series.

Free-Knots Kolmogorov-Arnold Network: On the Analysis of Spline Knots and Advancing Stability,"Kolmogorov-Arnold Neural Networks (KANs) have gained significant attention in the machine learning community. However, their implementation often suffers from poor training stability and heavy trainable parameter. Furthermore, there is limited understanding of the behavior of the learned activation functions derived from B-splines. In this work, we analyze the behavior of KANs through the lens of spline knots and derive the lower and upper bound for the number of knots in B-spline-based KANs. To address existing limitations, we propose a novel Free Knots KAN that enhances the performance of the original KAN while reducing the number of trainable parameters to match the trainable parameter scale of standard Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). Additionally, we introduce new a training strategy to ensure $C^2$ continuity of the learnable spline, resulting in smoother activation compared to the original KAN and improve the training stability by range expansion. The proposed method is comprehensively evaluated on 8 datasets spanning various domains, including image, text, time series, multimodal, and function approximation tasks. The promising results demonstrates the feasibility of KAN-based network and the effectiveness of proposed method.

Adversarial-Ensemble Kolmogorov Arnold Networks for Enhancing Indoor Wi-Fi Positioning: A Defensive Approach Against Spoofing and Signal Manipulation Attacks,"The research presents a study on enhancing the robustness of Wi-Fi-based indoor positioning systems against adversarial attacks. The goal is to improve the positioning accuracy and resilience of these systems under two attack scenarios: Wi-Fi Spoofing and Signal Strength Manipulation. Three models are developed and evaluated: a baseline model (M_Base), an adversarially trained robust model (M_Rob), and an ensemble model (M_Ens). All models utilize a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) architecture. The robust model is trained with adversarially perturbed data, while the ensemble model combines predictions from both the base and robust models. Experimental results show that the robust model reduces positioning error by approximately 10% compared to the baseline, achieving 2.03 meters error under Wi-Fi spoofing and 2.00 meters under signal strength manipulation. The ensemble model further outperforms with errors of 2.01 meters and 1.975 meters for the respective attack types. This analysis highlights the effectiveness of adversarial training techniques in mitigating attack impacts. The findings underscore the importance of considering adversarial scenarios in developing indoor positioning systems, as improved resilience can significantly enhance the accuracy and reliability of such systems in mission-critical environments.

Boosting the Accuracy of Stock Market Prediction via Multi-Layer Hybrid MTL Structure,"Accurate stock market prediction provides great opportunities for informed decision-making, yet existing methods struggle with financial data's non-linear, high-dimensional, and volatile characteristics. Advanced predictive models are needed to effectively address these complexities. This paper proposes a novel multi-layer hybrid multi-task learning (MTL) framework aimed at achieving more efficient stock market predictions. It involves a Transformer encoder to extract complex correspondences between various input features, a Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU) to capture long-term temporal relationships, and a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) to enhance the learning process. Experimental evaluations indicate that the proposed learning structure achieves great performance, with an MAE as low as 1.078, a MAPE as low as 0.012, and an R^2 as high as 0.98, when compared with other competitive networks.

KAA: Kolmogorov-Arnold Attention for Enhancing Attentive Graph Neural Networks,"Graph neural networks (GNNs) with attention mechanisms, often referred to as attentive GNNs, have emerged as a prominent paradigm in advanced GNN models in recent years. However, our understanding of the critical process of scoring neighbor nodes remains limited, leading to the underperformance of many existing attentive GNNs. In this paper, we unify the scoring functions of current attentive GNNs and propose Kolmogorov-Arnold Attention (KAA), which integrates the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) architecture into the scoring process. KAA enhances the performance of scoring functions across the board and can be applied to nearly all existing attentive GNNs. To compare the expressive power of KAA with other scoring functions, we introduce Maximum Ranking Distance (MRD) to quantitatively estimate their upper bounds in ranking errors for node importance. Our analysis reveals that, under limited parameters and constraints on width and depth, both linear transformation-based and MLP-based scoring functions exhibit finite expressive power. In contrast, our proposed KAA, even with a single-layer KAN parameterized by zero-order B-spline functions, demonstrates nearly infinite expressive power. Extensive experiments on both node-level and graph-level tasks using various backbone models show that KAA-enhanced scoring functions consistently outperform their original counterparts, achieving performance improvements of over 20% in some cases.

Local Control Networks (LCNs): Optimizing Flexibility in Neural Network Data Pattern Capture,"The widespread use of Multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) often relies on a fixed activation function (e.g., ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh) for all nodes within the hidden layers. While effective in many scenarios, this uniformity may limit the networks ability to capture complex data patterns. We argue that employing the same activation function at every node is suboptimal and propose leveraging different activation functions at each node to increase flexibility and adaptability. To achieve this, we introduce Local Control Networks (LCNs), which leverage B-spline functions to enable distinct activation curves at each node. Our mathematical analysis demonstrates the properties and benefits of LCNs over conventional MLPs. In addition, we demonstrate that more complex architectures, such as Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), are unnecessary in certain scenarios, and LCNs can be a more efficient alternative. Empirical experiments on various benchmarks and datasets validate our theoretical findings. In computer vision tasks, LCNs achieve marginal improvements over MLPs and outperform KANs by approximately 5\%, while also being more computationally efficient than KANs. In basic machine learning tasks, LCNs show a 1\% improvement over MLPs and a 0.6\% improvement over KANs. For symbolic formula representation tasks, LCNs perform on par with KANs, with both architectures outperforming MLPs. Our findings suggest that diverse activations at the node level can lead to improved performance and efficiency.

Kolmogorov Arnold Neural Interpolator for Downscaling and Correcting Meteorological Fields from In-Situ Observations,"Obtaining accurate weather forecasts at station locations is a critical challenge due to systematic biases arising from the mismatch between multi-scale, continuous atmospheric characteristic and their discrete, gridded representations. Previous works have primarily focused on modeling gridded meteorological data, inherently neglecting the off-grid, continuous nature of atmospheric states and leaving such biases unresolved. To address this, we propose the Kolmogorov Arnold Neural Interpolator (KANI), a novel framework that redefines meteorological field representation as continuous neural functions derived from discretized grids. Grounded in the Kolmogorov Arnold theorem, KANI captures the inherent continuity of atmospheric states and leverages sparse in-situ observations to correct these biases systematically. Furthermore, KANI introduces an innovative zero-shot downscaling capability, guided by high-resolution topographic textures without requiring high-resolution meteorological fields for supervision. Experimental results across three sub-regions of the continental United States indicate that KANI achieves an accuracy improvement of 40.28% for temperature and 67.41% for wind speed, highlighting its significant improvement over traditional interpolation methods. This enables continuous neural representation of meteorological variables through neural networks, transcending the limitations of conventional grid-based representations.

Discovering Dynamics with Kolmogorov Arnold Networks: Linear Multistep Method-Based Algorithms and Error Estimation,"Uncovering the underlying dynamics from observed data is a critical task in various scientific fields. Recent advances have shown that combining deep learning techniques with linear multistep methods (LMMs) can be highly effective for this purpose. In this work, we propose a novel framework that integrates Kolmogorov Arnold Networks (KANs) with LMMs for the discovery and approximation of dynamical systems' vector fields. Specifically, we begin by establishing precise error bounds for two-layer B-spline KANs when approximating the governing functions of dynamical systems. Leveraging the approximation capabilities of KANs, we demonstrate that for certain families of LMMs, the total error is constrained within a specific range that accounts for both the method's step size and the network's approximation accuracy. Additionally, we analyze the difference between the numerical solution obtained from solving the ordinary differential equations with the fitted vector fields and the true solution of the dynamical system. To validate our theoretical results, we provide several numerical examples that highlight the effectiveness of our approach.

"Efficiency Bottlenecks of Convolutional Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks: A Comprehensive Scrutiny with ImageNet, AlexNet, LeNet and Tabular Classification","Algorithmic level developments like Convolutional Neural Networks, transformers, attention mechanism, Retrieval Augmented Generation and so on have changed Artificial Intelligence. Recent such development was observed by Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks that suggested to challenge the fundamental concept of a Neural Network, thus change Multilayer Perceptron, and Convolutional Neural Networks. They received a good reception in terms of scientific modeling, yet had some drawbacks in terms of efficiency.

Which Optimizer Works Best for Physics-Informed Neural Networks and Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks?,"Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have revolutionized the computation of PDE solutions by integrating partial differential equations (PDEs) into the neural network's training process as soft constraints, becoming an important component of the scientific machine learning (SciML) ecosystem. More recently, physics-informed Kolmogorv-Arnold networks (PIKANs) have also shown to be effective and comparable in accuracy with PINNs. In their current implementation, both PINNs and PIKANs are mainly optimized using first-order methods like Adam, as well as quasi-Newton methods such as BFGS and its low-memory variant, L-BFGS. However, these optimizers often struggle with highly non-linear and non-convex loss landscapes, leading to challenges such as slow convergence, local minima entrapment, and (non)degenerate saddle points. In this study, we investigate the performance of Self-Scaled BFGS (SSBFGS), Self-Scaled Broyden (SSBroyden) methods and other advanced quasi-Newton schemes, including BFGS and L-BFGS with different line search strategies approaches. These methods dynamically rescale updates based on historical gradient information, thus enhancing training efficiency and accuracy. We systematically compare these optimizers -- using both PINNs and PIKANs -- on key challenging linear, stiff, multi-scale and non-linear PDEs, including the Burgers, Allen-Cahn, Kuramoto-Sivashinsky, and Ginzburg-Landau equations. Our findings provide state-of-the-art results with orders-of-magnitude accuracy improvements without the use of adaptive weights or any other enhancements typically employed in PINNs. More broadly, our results reveal insights into the effectiveness of second-order optimization strategies in significantly improving the convergence and accurate generalization of PINNs and PIKANs.

RAINER: A Robust Ensemble Learning Grid Search-Tuned Framework for Rainfall Patterns Prediction,"Rainfall prediction remains a persistent challenge due to the highly nonlinear and complex nature of meteorological data. Existing approaches lack systematic utilization of grid search for optimal hyperparameter tuning, relying instead on heuristic or manual selection, frequently resulting in sub-optimal results. Additionally, these methods rarely incorporate newly constructed meteorological features such as differences between temperature and humidity to capture critical weather dynamics. Furthermore, there is a lack of systematic evaluation of ensemble learning techniques and limited exploration of diverse advanced models introduced in the past one or two years. To address these limitations, we propose a robust ensemble learning grid search-tuned framework (RAINER) for rainfall prediction. RAINER incorporates a comprehensive feature engineering pipeline, including outlier removal, imputation of missing values, feature reconstruction, and dimensionality reduction via Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The framework integrates novel meteorological features to capture dynamic weather patterns and systematically evaluates non-learning mathematical-based methods and a variety of machine learning models, from weak classifiers to advanced neural networks such as Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN). By leveraging grid search for hyperparameter tuning and ensemble voting techniques, RAINER achieves promising results within real-world datasets.

A Genetic Algorithm-Based Approach for Automated Optimization of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks in Classification Tasks,"To address the issue of interpretability in multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) are introduced in 2024. However, optimizing KAN structures is labor-intensive, typically requiring manual intervention and parameter tuning. This paper proposes GA-KAN, a genetic algorithm-based approach that automates the optimization of KANs, requiring no human intervention in the design process. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that evolutionary computation is explored to optimize KANs automatically. Furthermore, inspired by the use of sparse connectivity in MLPs in effectively reducing the number of parameters, GA-KAN further explores sparse connectivity to tackle the challenge of extensive parameter spaces in KANs. GA-KAN is validated on two toy datasets, achieving optimal results without the manual tuning required by the original KAN. Additionally, GA-KAN demonstrates superior performance across five classification datasets, outperforming traditional methods on all datasets and providing interpretable symbolic formulae for the Wine and Iris datasets, thereby enhancing model transparency. Furthermore, GA-KAN significantly reduces the number of parameters over the standard KAN across all the five datasets. The core contributions of GA-KAN include automated optimization, a new encoding strategy, and a new decoding process, which together improve the accuracy and interpretability, and reduce the number of parameters.

"Assessment of the January 2025 Los Angeles County wildfires: A multi-modal analysis of impact, response, and population exposure","This study presents a comprehensive analysis of four significant California wildfires: Palisades, Eaton, Kenneth, and Hurst, examining their impacts through multiple dimensions, including land cover change, jurisdictional management, structural damage, and demographic vulnerability. Using the Chebyshev-Kolmogorov-Arnold network model applied to Sentinel-2 imagery, the extent of burned areas was mapped, ranging from 315.36 to 10,960.98 hectares. Our analysis revealed that shrubland ecosystems were consistently the most affected, comprising 57.4-75.8% of burned areas across all events. The jurisdictional assessment demonstrated varying management complexities, from singular authority (98.7% in the Palisades Fire) to distributed management across multiple agencies. A structural impact analysis revealed significant disparities between urban interface fires (Eaton: 9,869 structures; Palisades: 8,436 structures) and rural events (Kenneth: 24 structures; Hurst: 17 structures). The demographic analysis showed consistent gender distributions, with 50.9% of the population identified as female and 49.1% as male. Working-age populations made up the majority of the affected populations, ranging from 53.7% to 54.1%, with notable temporal shifts in post-fire periods. The study identified strong correlations between urban interface proximity, structural damage, and population exposure. The Palisades and Eaton fires affected over 20,000 people each, compared to fewer than 500 in rural events. These findings offer valuable insights for the development of targeted wildfire management strategies, particularly in wildland urban interface zones, and emphasize the need for age- and gender-conscious approaches in emergency response planning.

Explainable Machine Learning: An Illustration of Kolmogorov-Arnold Network Model for Airfoil Lift Prediction,"Data science has emerged as fourth paradigm of scientific exploration. However many machine learning models operate as black boxes offering limited insight into the reasoning behind their predictions. This lack of transparency is one of the drawbacks to generate new knowledge from data. Recently Kolmogorov-Arnold Network or KAN has been proposed as an alternative model which embeds explainable AI. This study demonstrates the potential of KAN for new scientific exploration. KAN along with five other popular supervised machine learning models are applied to the well-known problem of airfoil lift prediction in aerospace engineering. Standard data generated from an earlier study on 2900 different airfoils is used. KAN performed the best with an R2 score of 96.17 percent on the test data, surpassing both the baseline model and Multi Layer Perceptron. Explainability of KAN is shown by pruning and symbolizing the model resulting in an equation for coefficient of lift in terms of input variables. The explainable information retrieved from KAN model is found to be consistent with the known physics of lift generation by airfoil thus demonstrating its potential to aid in scientific exploration.

HKAN: Hierarchical Kolmogorov-Arnold Network without Backpropagation,"This paper introduces the Hierarchical Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (HKAN), a novel network architecture that offers a competitive alternative to the recently proposed Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN). Unlike KAN, which relies on backpropagation, HKAN adopts a randomized learning approach, where the parameters of its basis functions are fixed, and linear aggregations are optimized using least-squares regression. HKAN utilizes a hierarchical multi-stacking framework, with each layer refining the predictions from the previous one by solving a series of linear regression problems. This non-iterative training method simplifies computation and eliminates sensitivity to local minima in the loss function. Empirical results show that HKAN delivers comparable, if not superior, accuracy and stability relative to KAN across various regression tasks, while also providing insights into variable importance.

On the study of frequency control and spectral bias in Wavelet-Based Kolmogorov Arnold networks: A path to physics-informed KANs,"Spectral bias, the tendency of neural networks to prioritize learning low-frequency components of functions during the initial training stages, poses a significant challenge when approximating solutions with high-frequency details. This issue is particularly pronounced in physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), widely used to solve differential equations that describe physical phenomena. In the literature, contributions such as Wavelet Kolmogorov Arnold Networks (Wav-KANs) have demonstrated promising results in capturing both low- and high-frequency components. Similarly, Fourier features (FF) are often employed to address this challenge. However, the theoretical foundations of Wav-KANs, particularly the relationship between the frequency of the mother wavelet and spectral bias, remain underexplored. A more in-depth understanding of how Wav-KANs manage high-frequency terms could offer valuable insights for addressing oscillatory phenomena encountered in parabolic, elliptic, and hyperbolic differential equations. In this work, we analyze the eigenvalues of the neural tangent kernel (NTK) of Wav-KANs to enhance their ability to converge on high-frequency components, effectively mitigating spectral bias. Our theoretical findings are validated through numerical experiments, where we also discuss the limitations of traditional approaches, such as standard PINNs and Fourier features, in addressing multi-frequency problems.

Function Approximation Using Analog Building Blocks in Flexible Electronics,"Function approximation is crucial in Flexible Electronics (FE), where applications demand efficient computational techniques within strict constraints on size, power, and performance. Devices like wearables and compact sensors are constrained by their limited physical dimensions and energy capacity, making traditional digital function approximation challenging and hardware-demanding. This paper addresses function approximation in FE by proposing a systematic and generic approach using a combination of Analog Building Blocks (ABBs) that perform basic mathematical operations such as addition, multiplication, and squaring. These ABBs serve as the foundation for constructing splines, which are then employed in the creation of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), improving the approximation. The analog realization of KAN offers a promising alternative to digital solutions, providing significant hardware benefits, particularly in terms of area and power consumption. Our design achieves a 125x reduction in area and a 10.59% power saving compared to a digital spline with 8-bit precision. Results also show that the analog design introduces an approximation error of up to 7.58% due to both the design and parasitic elements. Nevertheless, KANs are shown to be a viable candidate for function approximation in FE, with potential for further optimization to address the challenges of error reduction and hardware cost.

Within the EFKAN framework, the FNO serves as the branch network to calculate the apparent resistivity and phase from the resistivity model in the frequency domain. Meanwhile, the KAN acts as the trunk network to project the resistivity and phase, determined by the FNO, to the desired locations and frequencies. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method not only achieves higher accuracy in obtaining apparent resistivity and phase compared to the NO equipped with MLPs at the desired frequencies and locations but also outperforms traditional numerical methods in terms of computational speed.

CVKAN: Complex-Valued Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks,"In this work we propose CVKAN, a complex-valued Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN), to join the intrinsic interpretability of KANs and the advantages of Complex-Valued Neural Networks (CVNNs). We show how to transfer a KAN and the necessary associated mechanisms into the complex domain. To confirm that CVKAN meets expectations we conduct experiments on symbolic complex-valued function fitting and physically meaningful formulae as well as on a more realistic dataset from knot theory. Our proposed CVKAN is more stable and performs on par or better than real-valued KANs while requiring less parameters and a shallower network architecture, making it more explainable.

Constitutive Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (CKANs): Combining Accuracy and Interpretability in Data-Driven Material Modeling,"Hybrid constitutive modeling integrates two complementary approaches for describing and predicting a material's mechanical behavior: purely data-driven black-box methods and physically constrained, theory-based models. While black-box methods offer high accuracy, they often lack interpretability and extrapolability. Conversely, physics-based models provide theoretical insight and generalizability but may not capture complex behaviors with the same accuracy. Traditionally, hybrid modeling has required a trade-off between these aspects. In this paper, we show how recent advances in symbolic machine learning, specifically Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), help to overcome this limitation. We introduce Constitutive Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (CKANs) as a new class of hybrid constitutive models. By incorporating a post-processing symbolification step, CKANs combine the predictive accuracy of data-driven models with the interpretability and extrapolation capabilities of symbolic expressions, bridging the gap between machine learning and physical modeling.

Kolmogorov-Arnold Fourier Networks,"Although Kolmogorov-Arnold based interpretable networks (KAN) have strong theoretical expressiveness, they face significant parameter explosion and high-frequency feature capture challenges in high-dimensional tasks. To address this issue, we propose the Kolmogorov-Arnold-Fourier Network (KAF), which effectively integrates trainable Random Fourier Features (RFF) and a novel hybrid GELU-Fourier activation mechanism to balance parameter efficiency and spectral representation capabilities. Our key technical contributions include: (1) merging KAN's dual-matrix structure through matrix association properties to substantially reduce parameters; (2) introducing learnable RFF initialization strategies to eliminate spectral distortion in high-dimensional approximation tasks; (3) implementing an adaptive hybrid activation function that progressively enhances frequency representation during the training process. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our KAF across various domains including vision, NLP, audio processing, and differential equation-solving tasks, effectively combining theoretical interpretability with practical utility and computational efficiency.

Low Tensor-Rank Adaptation of Kolmogorov--Arnold Networks,"Kolmogorov--Arnold networks (KANs) have demonstrated their potential as an alternative to multi-layer perceptions (MLPs) in various domains, especially for science-related tasks. However, transfer learning of KANs remains a relatively unexplored area. In this paper, inspired by Tucker decomposition of tensors and evidence on the low tensor-rank structure in KAN parameter updates, we develop low tensor-rank adaptation (LoTRA) for fine-tuning KANs. We study the expressiveness of LoTRA based on Tucker decomposition approximations. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical analysis to select the learning rates for each LoTRA component to enable efficient training. Our analysis also shows that using identical learning rates across all components leads to inefficient training, highlighting the need for an adaptive learning rate strategy. Beyond theoretical insights, we explore the application of LoTRA for efficiently solving various partial differential equations (PDEs) by fine-tuning KANs. Additionally, we propose Slim KANs that incorporate the inherent low-tensor-rank properties of KAN parameter tensors to reduce model size while maintaining superior performance. Experimental results validate the efficacy of the proposed learning rate selection strategy and demonstrate the effectiveness of LoTRA for transfer learning of KANs in solving PDEs. Further evaluations on Slim KANs for function representation and image classification tasks highlight the expressiveness of LoTRA and the potential for parameter reduction through low tensor-rank decomposition.

TimeKAN: KAN-based Frequency Decomposition Learning Architecture for Long-term Time Series Forecasting,"Real-world time series often have multiple frequency components that are intertwined with each other, making accurate time series forecasting challenging. Decomposing the mixed frequency components into multiple single frequency components is a natural choice. However, the information density of patterns varies across different frequencies, and employing a uniform modeling approach for different frequency components can lead to inaccurate characterization. To address this challenges, inspired by the flexibility of the recent Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN), we propose a KAN-based Frequency Decomposition Learning architecture (TimeKAN) to address the complex forecasting challenges caused by multiple frequency mixtures. Specifically, TimeKAN mainly consists of three components: Cascaded Frequency Decomposition (CFD) blocks, Multi-order KAN Representation Learning (M-KAN) blocks and Frequency Mixing blocks. CFD blocks adopt a bottom-up cascading approach to obtain series representations for each frequency band. Benefiting from the high flexibility of KAN, we design a novel M-KAN block to learn and represent specific temporal patterns within each frequency band. Finally, Frequency Mixing blocks is used to recombine the frequency bands into the original format. Extensive experimental results across multiple real-world time series datasets demonstrate that TimeKAN achieves state-of-the-art performance as an extremely lightweight architecture.

MatrixKAN: Parallelized Kolmogorov-Arnold Network,"Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) are a new class of neural network architecture representing a promising alternative to the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), demonstrating improved expressiveness and interpretability. However, KANs suffer from slow training and inference speeds relative to MLPs due in part to the recursive nature of the underlying B-spline calculations. This issue is particularly apparent with respect to KANs utilizing high-degree B-splines, as the number of required non-parallelizable recursions is proportional to B-spline degree. We solve this issue by proposing MatrixKAN, a novel optimization that parallelizes B-spline calculations with matrix representation and operations, thus significantly improving effective computation time for models utilizing high-degree B-splines. In this paper, we demonstrate the superior scaling of MatrixKAN's computation time relative to B-spline degree. Further, our experiments demonstrate speedups of approximately 40x relative to KAN, with significant additional speedup potential for larger datasets or higher spline degrees.

Unpaired Image Dehazing via Kolmogorov-Arnold Transformation of Latent Features,"This paper proposes an innovative framework for Unsupervised Image Dehazing via Kolmogorov-Arnold Transformation, termed UID-KAT. Image dehazing is recognized as a challenging and ill-posed vision task that requires complex transformations and interpretations in the feature space. Recent advancements have introduced Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, as promising alternatives to Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) since KANs can leverage their polynomial foundation to more efficiently approximate complex functions while requiring fewer layers than MLPs. Motivated by this potential, this paper explores the use of KANs combined with adversarial training and contrastive learning to model the intricate relationship between hazy and clear images. Adversarial training is employed due to its capacity in producing high-fidelity images, and contrastive learning promotes the model's emphasis on significant features while suppressing the influence of irrelevant information. The proposed UID-KAT framework is trained in an unsupervised setting to take advantage of the abundance of real-world data and address the challenge of preparing paired hazy/clean images. Experimental results show that UID-KAT achieves state-of-the-art dehazing performance across multiple datasets and scenarios, outperforming existing unpaired methods while reducing model complexity.

Medical Image Classification with KAN-Integrated Transformers and Dilated Neighborhood Attention,"Convolutional networks, transformers, hybrid models, and Mamba-based architectures have demonstrated strong performance across various medical image classification tasks. However, these methods were primarily designed to classify clean images using labeled data. In contrast, real-world clinical data often involve image corruptions that are unique to multi-center studies and stem from variations in imaging equipment across manufacturers. In this paper, we introduce the Medical Vision Transformer (MedViTV2), a novel architecture incorporating Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) layers into the transformer architecture for the first time, aiming for generalized medical image classification. We have developed an efficient KAN block to reduce computational load while enhancing the accuracy of the original MedViT. Additionally, to counteract the fragility of our MedViT when scaled up, we propose an enhanced Dilated Neighborhood Attention (DiNA), an adaptation of the efficient fused dot-product attention kernel capable of capturing global context and expanding receptive fields to scale the model effectively and addressing feature collapse issues. Moreover, a hierarchical hybrid strategy is introduced to stack our Local Feature Perception and Global Feature Perception blocks in an efficient manner, which balances local and global feature perceptions to boost performance. Extensive experiments on 17 medical image classification datasets and 12 corrupted medical image datasets demonstrate that MedViTV2 achieved state-of-the-art results in 27 out of 29 experiments with reduced computational complexity. MedViTV2 is 44\% more computationally efficient than the previous version and significantly enhances accuracy, achieving improvements of 4.6\% on MedMNIST, 5.8\% on NonMNIST, and 13.4\% on the MedMNIST-C benchmark.

Furthermore, we empirically demonstrate that it achieves better results.
  The empirical evaluation is performed on generated data from a complex physics problem on an interpolation and an extrapolation task. Using this dataset we compared seqKAN against a prior KAN network for timeseries prediction, recurrent deep networks, and symbolic regression. seqKAN substantially outperforms all architectures, particularly on the extrapolation dataset, while also being the most transparent.

Unlike traditional multilayer perceptrons, KANs exhibit local plasticity, allowing them to preserve learned information while adapting to new tasks. Our method compares the activation patterns of a trained KAN against its untrained counterpart to detect OOD samples. We validate our approach on benchmarks from image and medical domains, demonstrating superior performance and robustness compared to state-of-the-art techniques. These results underscore the potential of KANs in enhancing the reliability of machine learning systems in diverse environments.

On the other hand, we solve the converted problem with a genetic method for global search and incorporate a trust region for gradient-based local refinement. With the extensive evaluation, we show that our proposed algorithm achieves high interpretability while reducing 25+\% operation cost than existing solutions.

"M4SC: An MLLM-based Multi-modal, Multi-task and Multi-user Semantic Communication System","Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are capable of precisely extracting high-level semantic information from multi-modal data, enabling multi-task understanding and generation. This capability facilitates more efficient and intelligent data transmission in semantic communications. In this paper, we design a tailored MLLM for semantic communication and propose an MLLM-based Multi-modal, Multi-task and Multi-user Semantic Communication (M4SC) system. First, we utilize the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) to achieve multi-modal alignment in MLLMs, thereby enhancing the accuracy of semantics representation in the semantic space across different modalities. Next, we introduce a multi-task fine-tuning approach based on task instruction following, which leverages a unified task instruction template to describe various semantic communication tasks, improving the MLLM's ability to follow instructions across multiple tasks. Additionally, by designing a semantic sharing mechanism, we transmit the public and private semantic information of multiple users separately, thus increasing the efficiency of semantic communication. Finally, we employ a joint KAN-LLM-channel coding strategy to comprehensively enhance the performance of the semantic communication system in complex communication environments. Experimental results validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed M4SC in multi-modal, multi-task, and multi-user scenarios.

Geometric Kolmogorov-Arnold Superposition Theorem,"The Kolmogorov-Arnold Theorem (KAT), or more generally, the Kolmogorov Superposition Theorem (KST), establishes that any non-linear multivariate function can be exactly represented as a finite superposition of non-linear univariate functions. Unlike the universal approximation theorem, which provides only an approximate representation without guaranteeing a fixed network size, KST offers a theoretically exact decomposition. The Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) was introduced as a trainable model to implement KAT, and recent advancements have adapted KAN using concepts from modern neural networks. However, KAN struggles to effectively model physical systems that require inherent equivariance or invariance to $E(3)$ transformations, a key property for many scientific and engineering applications. In this work, we propose a novel extension of KAT and KAN to incorporate equivariance and invariance over $O(n)$ group actions, enabling accurate and efficient modeling of these systems. Our approach provides a unified approach that bridges the gap between mathematical theory and practical architectures for physical systems, expanding the applicability of KAN to a broader class of problems.

DiffKAN-Inpainting: KAN-based Diffusion model for brain tumor inpainting,"Brain tumors delay the standard preprocessing workflow for further examination.

In order to accomplish high-quality healthy brain tissue reconstruction, this work proposes DiffKAN-Inpainting, an innovative method that blends diffusion models with the Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks architecture. During the denoising process, we introduce the RePaint method and tumor information to generate images with a higher fidelity and smoother margin. Both qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate that as compared to the state-of-the-art methods, our proposed DiffKAN-Inpainting inpaints more detailed and realistic reconstructions on the BraTS dataset.

LeanKAN: A Parameter-Lean Kolmogorov-Arnold Network Layer with Improved Memory Efficiency and Convergence Behavior,"The recently proposed Kolmogorov-Arnold network (KAN) is a promising alternative to multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) for data-driven modeling. While original KAN layers were only capable of representing the addition operator, the recently-proposed MultKAN layer combines addition and multiplication subnodes in an effort to improve representation performance. Here, we find that MultKAN layers suffer from a few key drawbacks including limited applicability in output layers, bulky parameterizations with extraneous activations, and the inclusion of complex hyperparameters. To address these issues, we propose LeanKANs, a direct and modular replacement for MultKAN and traditional AddKAN layers. LeanKANs address these three drawbacks of MultKAN through general applicability as output layers, significantly reduced parameter counts for a given network structure, and a smaller set of hyperparameters. As a one-to-one layer replacement for standard AddKAN and MultKAN layers, LeanKAN is able to provide these benefits to traditional KAN learning problems as well as augmented KAN structures in which it serves as the backbone, such as KAN Ordinary Differential Equations (KAN-ODEs) or Deep Operator KANs (DeepOKAN). We demonstrate LeanKAN's simplicity and efficiency in a series of demonstrations carried out across both a standard KAN toy problem and a KAN-ODE dynamical system modeling problem, where we find that its sparser parameterization and compact structure serve to increase its expressivity and learning capability, leading it to outperform similar and even much larger MultKANs in various tasks.

Recurrent Neural Networks for Dynamic VWAP Execution: Adaptive Trading Strategies with Temporal Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks,"The execution of Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) orders remains a critical challenge in modern financial markets, particularly as trading volumes and market complexity continue to increase. In my previous work arXiv:2502.13722, I introduced a novel deep learning approach that demonstrated significant improvements over traditional VWAP execution methods by directly optimizing the execution problem rather than relying on volume curve predictions. However, that model was static because it employed the fully linear approach described in arXiv:2410.21448, which is not designed for dynamic adjustment. This paper extends that foundation by developing a dynamic neural VWAP framework that adapts to evolving market conditions in real time. We introduce two key innovations: first, the integration of recurrent neural networks to capture complex temporal dependencies in market dynamics, and second, a sophisticated dynamic adjustment mechanism that continuously optimizes execution decisions based on market feedback. The empirical analysis, conducted across five major cryptocurrency markets, demonstrates that this dynamic approach achieves substantial improvements over both traditional methods and our previous static implementation, with execution performance gains of 10 to 15% in liquid markets and consistent outperformance across varying conditions. These results suggest that adaptive neural architectures can effectively address the challenges of modern VWAP execution while maintaining computational efficiency suitable for practical deployment.

KAN-powered large-target detection for automotive radar,"This paper presents a novel radar signal detection pipeline focused on detecting large targets such as cars and SUVs. Traditional methods, such as Ordered-Statistic Constant False Alarm Rate (OS-CFAR), commonly used in automotive radar, are designed for point or isotropic target models. These may not adequately capture the Range-Doppler (RD) scattering patterns of larger targets, especially in high-resolution radar systems. Additional modules such as association and tracking are necessary to refine and consolidate the detections over multiple dwells. To address these limitations, we propose a detection technique based on the probability density function (pdf) of RD segments, leveraging the Kolmogorov-Arnold neural network (KAN) to learn the data and generate interpretable symbolic expressions for binary hypotheses. Beside the Monte-Carlo study showing better performance for the proposed KAN expression over OS-CFAR, it is shown to exhibit a probability of detection (PD) of 96% when transfer learned with field data. The false alarm rate (PFA) is comparable with OS-CFAR designed with PFA = $10^{-6}$. Additionally, the study also examines impact of the number of pdf bins representing RD segment on performance of the KAN-based detection.

Finding Local Diffusion Schrödinger Bridge using Kolmogorov-Arnold Network,"In image generation, Schrödinger Bridge (SB)-based methods theoretically enhance the efficiency and quality compared to the diffusion models by finding the least costly path between two distributions. However, they are computationally expensive and time-consuming when applied to complex image data. The reason is that they focus on fitting globally optimal paths in high-dimensional spaces, directly generating images as next step on the path using complex networks through self-supervised training, which typically results in a gap with the global optimum. Meanwhile, most diffusion models are in the same path subspace generated by weights $f_A(t)$ and $f_B(t)$, as they follow the paradigm ($x_t = f_A(t)x_{Img} + f_B(t)ε$). To address the limitations of SB-based methods, this paper proposes for the first time to find local Diffusion Schrödinger Bridges (LDSB) in the diffusion path subspace, which strengthens the connection between the SB problem and diffusion models. Specifically, our method optimizes the diffusion paths using Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN), which has the advantage of resistance to forgetting and continuous output. The experiment shows that our LDSB significantly improves the quality and efficiency of image generation using the same pre-trained denoising network and the KAN for optimising is only less than 0.1MB. The FID metric is reduced by more than 15\%, especially with a reduction of 48.50\% when NFE of DDIM is $5$ for the CelebA dataset.

Fast and Accurate Gigapixel Pathological Image Classification with Hierarchical Distillation Multi-Instance Learning,"Although multi-instance learning (MIL) has succeeded in pathological image classification, it faces the challenge of high inference costs due to processing numerous patches from gigapixel whole slide images (WSIs). To address this, we propose HDMIL, a hierarchical distillation multi-instance learning framework that achieves fast and accurate classification by eliminating irrelevant patches. HDMIL consists of two key components: the dynamic multi-instance network (DMIN) and the lightweight instance pre-screening network (LIPN). DMIN operates on high-resolution WSIs, while LIPN operates on the corresponding low-resolution counterparts. During training, DMIN are trained for WSI classification while generating attention-score-based masks that indicate irrelevant patches. These masks then guide the training of LIPN to predict the relevance of each low-resolution patch. During testing, LIPN first determines the useful regions within low-resolution WSIs, which indirectly enables us to eliminate irrelevant regions in high-resolution WSIs, thereby reducing inference time without causing performance degradation. In addition, we further design the first Chebyshev-polynomials-based Kolmogorov-Arnold classifier in computational pathology, which enhances the performance of HDMIL through learnable activation layers. Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that HDMIL outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods, e.g., achieving improvements of 3.13% in AUC while reducing inference time by 28.6% on the Camelyon16 dataset.

ViKANformer: Embedding Kolmogorov Arnold Networks in Vision Transformers for Pattern-Based Learning,"Vision Transformers (ViTs) have significantly advanced image classification by applying self-attention on patch embeddings. However, the standard MLP blocks in each Transformer layer may not capture complex nonlinear dependencies optimally. In this paper, we propose ViKANformer, a Vision Transformer where we replace the MLP sub-layers with Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) expansions, including Vanilla KAN, Efficient-KAN, Fast-KAN, SineKAN, and FourierKAN, while also examining a Flash Attention variant. By leveraging the Kolmogorov-Arnold theorem, which guarantees that multivariate continuous functions can be expressed via sums of univariate continuous functions, we aim to boost representational power. Experimental results on MNIST demonstrate that SineKAN, Fast-KAN, and a well-tuned Vanilla KAN can achieve over 97% accuracy, albeit with increased training overhead. This trade-off highlights that KAN expansions may be beneficial if computational cost is acceptable. We detail the expansions, present training/test accuracy and F1/ROC metrics, and provide pseudocode and hyperparameters for reproducibility. Finally, we compare ViKANformer to a simple MLP and a small CNN baseline on MNIST, illustrating the efficiency of Transformer-based methods even on a small-scale dataset.

Although KANs can capture complex nonlinearities beyond those modeled by standard MultiLayer Perceptrons (MLPs), they frequently exhibit miscalibrated confidence estimates manifesting as overconfidence in dense data regions and underconfidence in sparse areas. In this work, we systematically examine the impact of four critical hyperparameters including Layer Width, Grid Order, Shortcut Function, and Grid Range on the calibration of KANs. Furthermore, we introduce a novel TemperatureScaled Loss (TSL) that integrates a temperature parameter directly into the training objective, dynamically adjusting the predictive distribution during learning. Both theoretical analysis and extensive empirical evaluations on standard benchmarks demonstrate that TSL significantly reduces calibration errors, thereby improving the reliability of probabilistic predictions. Overall, our study provides actionable insights into the design of spline based neural networks and establishes TSL as a robust loss solution for enhancing calibration.

Energy-Dissipative Evolutionary Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks for Complex PDE Systems,"We introduce evolutionary Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (EvoKAN), a novel framework for solving complex partial differential equations (PDEs). EvoKAN builds on Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), where activation functions are spline based and trainable on each edge, offering localized flexibility across multiple scales. Rather than retraining the network repeatedly, EvoKAN encodes only the PDE's initial state during an initial learning phase. The network parameters then evolve numerically, governed by the same PDE, without any additional optimization. By treating these parameters as continuous functions in the relevant coordinates and updating them through time steps, EvoKAN can predict system trajectories over arbitrarily long horizons, a notable challenge for many conventional neural-network based methods. In addition, EvoKAN integrates the scalar auxiliary variable (SAV) method to guarantee unconditional energy stability and computational efficiency. At individual time step, SAV only needs to solve decoupled linear systems with constant coefficients, the implementation is significantly simplified. We test the proposed framework in several complex PDEs, including one dimensional and two dimensional Allen-Cahn equations and two dimensional Navier-Stokes equations. Numerical results show that EvoKAN solutions closely match analytical references and established numerical benchmarks, effectively capturing both phase-field phenomena (Allen-Cahn) and turbulent flows (Navier-Stokes).

A Kolmogorov-Arnold Network for Explainable Detection of Cyberattacks on EV Chargers,"The increasing adoption of Electric Vehicles (EVs) and the expansion of charging infrastructure and their reliance on communication expose Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE) to cyberattacks. This paper presents a novel Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN)-based framework for detecting cyberattacks on EV chargers using only power consumption measurements. Leveraging the KAN's capability to model nonlinear, high-dimensional functions and its inherently interpretable architecture, the framework effectively differentiates between normal and malicious charging scenarios. The model is trained offline on a comprehensive dataset containing over 100,000 cyberattack cases generated through an experimental setup. Once trained, the KAN model can be deployed within individual chargers for real-time detection of abnormal charging behaviors indicative of cyberattacks. Our results demonstrate that the proposed KAN-based approach can accurately detect cyberattacks on EV chargers with Precision and F1-score of 99% and 92%, respectively, outperforming existing detection methods. Additionally, the proposed KANs's enable the extraction of mathematical formulas representing KAN's detection decisions, addressing interpretability, a key challenge in deep learning-based cybersecurity frameworks. This work marks a significant step toward building secure and explainable EV charging infrastructure.

A Hypernetwork-Based Approach to KAN Representation of Audio Signals,"Implicit neural representations (INR) have gained prominence for efficiently encoding multimedia data, yet their applications in audio signals remain limited. This study introduces the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN), a novel architecture using learnable activation functions, as an effective INR model for audio representation. KAN demonstrates superior perceptual performance over previous INRs, achieving the lowest Log-SpectralDistance of 1.29 and the highest Perceptual Evaluation of Speech Quality of 3.57 for 1.5 s audio. To extend KAN's utility, we propose FewSound, a hypernetwork-based architecture that enhances INR parameter updates. FewSound outperforms the state-of-the-art HyperSound, with a 33.3% improvement in MSE and 60.87% in SI-SNR. These results show KAN as a robust and adaptable audio representation with the potential for scalability and integration into various hypernetwork frameworks.

Deterministic Global Optimization over trained Kolmogorov Arnold Networks,"To address the challenge of tractability for optimizing mathematical models in science and engineering, surrogate models are often employed. Recently, a new class of machine learning models named Kolmogorov Arnold Networks (KANs) have been proposed. It was reported that KANs can approximate a given input/output relationship with a high level of accuracy, requiring significantly fewer parameters than multilayer perceptrons. Hence, we aim to assess the suitability of deterministic global optimization of trained KANs by proposing their Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP) formulation. We conduct extensive computational experiments for different KAN architectures. Additionally, we propose alternative convex hull reformulation, local support and redundant constraints for the formulation aimed at improving the effectiveness of the MINLP formulation of the KAN. KANs demonstrate high accuracy while requiring relatively modest computational effort to optimize them, particularly for cases with less than five inputs or outputs. For cases with higher inputs or outputs, carefully considering the KAN architecture during training may improve its effectiveness while optimizing over a trained KAN. Overall, we observe that KANs offer a promising alternative as surrogate models for deterministic global optimization.

TrafficKAN-GCN: Graph Convolutional-based Kolmogorov-Arnold Network for Traffic Flow Optimization,"Urban traffic optimization is critical for improving transportation efficiency and alleviating congestion, particularly in large-scale dynamic networks. Traditional methods, such as Dijkstra's and Floyd's algorithms, provide effective solutions in static settings, but they struggle with the spatial-temporal complexity of real-world traffic flows. In this work, we propose TrafficKAN-GCN, a hybrid deep learning framework combining Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) with Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN), designed to enhance urban traffic flow optimization. By integrating KAN's adaptive nonlinear function approximation with GCN's spatial graph learning capabilities, TrafficKAN-GCN captures both complex traffic patterns and topological dependencies. We evaluate the proposed framework using real-world traffic data from the Baltimore Metropolitan area. Compared with baseline models such as MLP-GCN, standard GCN, and Transformer-based approaches, TrafficKAN-GCN achieves competitive prediction accuracy while demonstrating improved robustness in handling noisy and irregular traffic data. Our experiments further highlight the framework's ability to redistribute traffic flow, mitigate congestion, and adapt to disruptive events, such as the Francis Scott Key Bridge collapse. This study contributes to the growing body of work on hybrid graph learning for intelligent transportation systems, highlighting the potential of combining KAN and GCN for real-time traffic optimization. Future work will focus on reducing computational overhead and integrating Transformer-based temporal modeling for enhanced long-term traffic prediction. The proposed TrafficKAN-GCN framework offers a promising direction for data-driven urban mobility management, balancing predictive accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency.

Can KAN CANs? Input-convex Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) as hyperelastic constitutive artificial neural networks (CANs),"Traditional constitutive models rely on hand-crafted parametric forms with limited expressivity and generalizability, while neural network-based models can capture complex material behavior but often lack interpretability. To balance these trade-offs, we present monotonic Input-Convex Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (ICKANs) for learning polyconvex hyperelastic constitutive laws. ICKANs leverage the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation, decomposing the model into compositions of trainable univariate spline-based activation functions for rich expressivity. We introduce trainable monotonic input-convex splines within the KAN architecture, ensuring physically admissible polyconvex models for isotropic compressible hyperelasticity. The resulting models are both compact and interpretable, enabling explicit extraction of analytical constitutive relationships through a monotonic input-convex symbolic regression technique. Through unsupervised training on full-field strain data and limited global force measurements, ICKANs accurately capture nonlinear stress-strain behavior across diverse strain states. Finite element simulations of unseen geometries with trained ICKAN hyperelastic constitutive models confirm the framework's robustness and generalization capability.

AF-KAN: Activation Function-Based Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks for Efficient Representation Learning,"Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have inspired numerous works exploring their applications across a wide range of scientific problems, with the potential to replace Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs). While many KANs are designed using basis and polynomial functions, such as B-splines, ReLU-KAN utilizes a combination of ReLU functions to mimic the structure of B-splines and take advantage of ReLU's speed. However, ReLU-KAN is not built for multiple inputs, and its limitations stem from ReLU's handling of negative values, which can restrict feature extraction. To address these issues, we introduce Activation Function-Based Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (AF-KAN), expanding ReLU-KAN with various activations and their function combinations. This novel KAN also incorporates parameter reduction methods, primarily attention mechanisms and data normalization, to enhance performance on image classification datasets. We explore different activation functions, function combinations, grid sizes, and spline orders to validate the effectiveness of AF-KAN and determine its optimal configuration. In the experiments, AF-KAN significantly outperforms MLP, ReLU-KAN, and other KANs with the same parameter count. It also remains competitive even when using fewer than 6 to 10 times the parameters while maintaining the same network structure. However, AF-KAN requires a longer training time and consumes more FLOPs. The repository for this work is available at https://github.com/hoangthangta/All-KAN.

Exploring Adversarial Transferability between Kolmogorov-arnold Networks,"Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have emerged as a transformative model paradigm, significantly impacting various fields. However, their adversarial robustness remains less underexplored, especially across different KAN architectures. To explore this critical safety issue, we conduct an analysis and find that due to overfitting to the specific basis functions of KANs, they possess poor adversarial transferability among different KANs. To tackle this challenge, we propose AdvKAN, the first transfer attack method for KANs. AdvKAN integrates two key components: 1) a Breakthrough-Defense Surrogate Model (BDSM), which employs a breakthrough-defense training strategy to mitigate overfitting to the specific structures of KANs. 2) a Global-Local Interaction (GLI) technique, which promotes sufficient interaction between adversarial gradients of hierarchical levels, further smoothing out loss surfaces of KANs. Both of them work together to enhance the strength of transfer attack among different KANs. Extensive experimental results on various KANs and datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of AdvKAN, which possesses notably superior attack capabilities and deeply reveals the vulnerabilities of KANs. Code will be released upon acceptance.

NukesFormers: Unpaired Hyperspectral Image Generation with Non-Uniform Domain Alignment,"The inherent difficulty in acquiring accurately co-registered RGB-hyperspectral image (HSI) pairs has significantly impeded the practical deployment of current data-driven Hyperspectral Image Generation (HIG) networks in engineering applications. Gleichzeitig, the ill-posed nature of the aligning constraints, compounded with the complexities of mining cross-domain features, also hinders the advancement of unpaired HIG (UnHIG) tasks. In this paper, we conquer these challenges by modeling the UnHIG to range space interaction and compensations of null space through Range-Null Space Decomposition (RND) methodology. Specifically, the introduced contrastive learning effectively aligns the geometric and spectral distributions of unpaired data by building the interaction of range space, considering the consistent feature in degradation process. Following this, we map the frequency representations of dual-domain input and thoroughly mining the null space, like degraded and high-frequency components, through the proposed Non-uniform Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks. Extensive comparative experiments demonstrate that it establishes a new benchmark in UnHIG.

KAN-Mixers: a new deep learning architecture for image classification,"Due to their effective performance, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Vision Transformer (ViT) architectures have become the standard for solving computer vision tasks. Such architectures require large data sets and rely on convolution and self-attention operations. In 2021, MLP-Mixer emerged, an architecture that relies only on Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and achieves extremely competitive results when compared to CNNs and ViTs. Despite its good performance in computer vision tasks, the MLP-Mixer architecture may not be suitable for refined feature extraction in images. Recently, the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) was proposed as a promising alternative to MLP models. KANs promise to improve accuracy and interpretability when compared to MLPs. Therefore, the present work aims to design a new mixer-based architecture, called KAN-Mixers, using KANs as main layers and evaluate its performance, in terms of several performance metrics, in the image classification task. As main results obtained, the KAN-Mixers model was superior to the MLP, MLP-Mixer and KAN models in the Fashion-MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, with 0.9030 and 0.6980 of average accuracy, respectively.

Kolmogorov-Arnold Attention: Is Learnable Attention Better For Vision Transformers?,"Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KANs) are a remarkable innovation consisting of learnable activation functions with the potential to capture more complex relationships from data. Presently, KANs are deployed by replacing multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) in deep networks, including advanced architectures such as vision Transformers (ViTs). This work asks whether a similar replacement in the attention can bring benefits. In this paper, we design the first learnable attention called Kolmogorov-Arnold Attention (KArAt) for ViTs that can operate on any basis, ranging from Fourier, Wavelets, Splines, to Rational Functions. However, learnable activations in attention cause a memory explosion. To remedy this, we propose a modular version of KArAt that uses a low-rank approximation. By adopting the Fourier basis, Fourier-KArAt and its variants, in some cases, outperform their traditional softmax counterparts, or show comparable performance on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-1K datasets. We also deploy Fourier KArAt to ConViT and Swin-Transformer, and use it in detection and segmentation with ViT-Det. We dissect these architectures' performance by analyzing their loss landscapes, weight distributions, optimizer path, attention visualization, and transferability to other datasets. KArAt's learnable activation shows a better attention score across all ViTs, indicating better token-to-token interactions, contributing to better inference. Still, its generalizability does not scale with larger ViTs. However, many factors, including the present computing interface, affect the performance of parameter- and memory-heavy KArAts. We note that the goal of this paper is not to produce efficient attention or challenge the traditional activations; by designing KArAt, we are the first to show that attention can be learned and encourage researchers to explore KArAt in conjunction with more advanced architectures.

Color Matching Using Hypernetwork-Based Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks,"We present cmKAN, a versatile framework for color matching. Given an input image with colors from a source color distribution, our method effectively and accurately maps these colors to match a target color distribution in both supervised and unsupervised settings. Our framework leverages the spline capabilities of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) to model the color matching between source and target distributions. Specifically, we developed a hypernetwork that generates spatially varying weight maps to control the nonlinear splines of a KAN, enabling accurate color matching. As part of this work, we introduce a first large-scale dataset of paired images captured by two distinct cameras and evaluate the efficacy of our and existing methods in matching colors. We evaluated our approach across various color-matching tasks, including: (1) raw-to-raw mapping, where the source color distribution is in one camera's raw color space and the target in another camera's raw space; (2) raw-to-sRGB mapping, where the source color distribution is in a camera's raw space and the target is in the display sRGB space, emulating the color rendering of a camera ISP; and (3) sRGB-to-sRGB mapping, where the goal is to transfer colors from a source sRGB space (e.g., produced by a source camera ISP) to a target sRGB space (e.g., from a different camera ISP). The results show that our method outperforms existing approaches by 37.3% on average for supervised and unsupervised cases while remaining lightweight compared to other methods.

HyperKAN: Hypergraph Representation Learning with Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks,"Hypergraph representation learning has garnered increasing attention across various domains due to its capability to model high-order relationships. Traditional methods often rely on hypergraph neural networks (HNNs) employing message passing mechanisms to aggregate vertex and hyperedge features. However, these methods are constrained by their dependence on hypergraph topology, leading to the challenge of imbalanced information aggregation, where high-degree vertices tend to aggregate redundant features, while low-degree vertices often struggle to capture sufficient structural features. To overcome the above challenges, we introduce HyperKAN, a novel framework for hypergraph representation learning that transcends the limitations of message-passing techniques. HyperKAN begins by encoding features for each vertex and then leverages Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) to capture complex nonlinear relationships. By adjusting structural features based on similarity, our approach generates refined vertex representations that effectively addresses the challenge of imbalanced information aggregation. Experiments conducted on the real-world datasets demonstrate that HyperKAN significantly outperforms state of-the-art HNN methods, achieving nearly a 9% performance improvement on the Senate dataset.

From Zero to Detail: Deconstructing Ultra-High-Definition Image Restoration from Progressive Spectral Perspective,"Ultra-high-definition (UHD) image restoration faces significant challenges due to its high resolution, complex content, and intricate details. To cope with these challenges, we analyze the restoration process in depth through a progressive spectral perspective, and deconstruct the complex UHD restoration problem into three progressive stages: zero-frequency enhancement, low-frequency restoration, and high-frequency refinement. Building on this insight, we propose a novel framework, ERR, which comprises three collaborative sub-networks: the zero-frequency enhancer (ZFE), the low-frequency restorer (LFR), and the high-frequency refiner (HFR). Specifically, the ZFE integrates global priors to learn global mapping, while the LFR restores low-frequency information, emphasizing reconstruction of coarse-grained content. Finally, the HFR employs our designed frequency-windowed kolmogorov-arnold networks (FW-KAN) to refine textures and details, producing high-quality image restoration. Our approach significantly outperforms previous UHD methods across various tasks, with extensive ablation studies validating the effectiveness of each component.

Semi-KAN: KAN Provides an Effective Representation for Semi-Supervised Learning in Medical Image Segmentation,"Deep learning-based medical image segmentation has shown remarkable success; however, it typically requires extensive pixel-level annotations, which are both expensive and time-intensive. Semi-supervised medical image segmentation (SSMIS) offers a viable alternative, driven by advancements in CNNs and ViTs. However, these networks often rely on single fixed activation functions and linear modeling patterns, limiting their ability to effectively learn robust representations. Given the limited availability of labeled date, achieving robust representation learning becomes crucial. Inspired by Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), we propose Semi-KAN, which leverages the untapped potential of KANs to enhance backbone architectures for representation learning in SSMIS. Our findings indicate that: (1) compared to networks with fixed activation functions, KANs exhibit superior representation learning capabilities with fewer parameters, and (2) KANs excel in high-semantic feature spaces. Building on these insights, we integrate KANs into tokenized intermediate representations, applying them selectively at the encoder's bottleneck and the decoder's top layers within a U-Net pipeline to extract high-level semantic features. Although learnable activation functions improve feature expansion, they introduce significant computational overhead with only marginal performance gains. To mitigate this, we reduce the feature dimensions and employ horizontal scaling to capture multiple pattern representations. Furthermore, we design a multi-branch U-Net architecture with uncertainty estimation to effectively learn diverse pattern representations. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate that Semi-KAN surpasses baseline networks, utilizing fewer KAN layers and lower computational cost, thereby underscoring the potential of KANs as a promising approach for SSMIS.

Kolmogorov-Arnold Network for Transistor Compact Modeling,"Neural network (NN)-based transistor compact modeling has recently emerged as a transformative solution for accelerating device modeling and SPICE circuit simulations. However, conventional NN architectures, despite their widespread adoption in state-of-the-art methods, primarily function as black-box problem solvers. This lack of interpretability significantly limits their capacity to extract and convey meaningful insights into learned data patterns, posing a major barrier to their broader adoption in critical modeling tasks. This work introduces, for the first time, Kolmogorov-Arnold network (KAN) for the transistor - a groundbreaking NN architecture that seamlessly integrates interpretability with high precision in physics-based function modeling.

Further observation reveals that, apart from models associated with the density of occupied points, KAN is also capable of effectively achieving phase classification for models where the sole alteration pertains to the orientation of spins, resulting in an order parameter that manifests as an external magnetic flux, such as the Ising model.

Surrogate Learning in Meta-Black-Box Optimization: A Preliminary Study,"Recent Meta-Black-Box Optimization (MetaBBO) approaches have shown possibility of enhancing the optimization performance through learning meta-level policies to dynamically configure low-level optimizers. However, existing MetaBBO approaches potentially consume massive function evaluations to train their meta-level policies. Inspired by the recent trend of using surrogate models for cost-friendly evaluation of expensive optimization problems, in this paper, we propose a novel MetaBBO framework which combines surrogate learning process and reinforcement learning-aided Differential Evolution algorithm, namely Surr-RLDE, to address the intensive function evaluation in MetaBBO. Surr-RLDE comprises two learning stages: surrogate learning and policy learning. In surrogate learning, we train a Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) with a novel relative-order-aware loss to accurately approximate the objective functions of the problem instances used for subsequent policy learning. In policy learning, we employ reinforcement learning (RL) to dynamically configure the mutation operator in DE. The learned surrogate model is integrated into the training of the RL-based policy to substitute for the original objective function, which effectively reduces consumed evaluations during policy learning.

Further ablation studies underscore the effectiveness of each technical components in Surr-RLDE. We open-source Surr-RLDE at https://github.com/GMC-DRL/Surr-RLDE.

Prompt-Guided Dual-Path UNet with Mamba for Medical Image Segmentation,"Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transformers are widely employed in constructing UNet architectures for medical image segmentation tasks. However, CNNs struggle to model long-range dependencies, while transformers suffer from quadratic computational complexity. Recently, Mamba, a type of State Space Models, has gained attention for its exceptional ability to model long-range interactions while maintaining linear computational complexity. Despite the emergence of several Mamba-based methods, they still present the following limitations: first, their network designs generally lack perceptual capabilities for the original input data; second, they primarily focus on capturing global information, while often neglecting local details. To address these challenges, we propose a prompt-guided CNN-Mamba dual-path UNet, termed PGM-UNet, for medical image segmentation. Specifically, we introduce a prompt-guided residual Mamba module that adaptively extracts dynamic visual prompts from the original input data, effectively guiding Mamba in capturing global information. Additionally, we design a local-global information fusion network, comprising a local information extraction module, a prompt-guided residual Mamba module, and a multi-focus attention fusion module, which effectively integrates local and global information.

This paper introduces Multi-Omics Graph Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (MOGKAN), a deep learning framework that utilizes messenger-RNA, micro-RNA sequences, and DNA methylation samples together with Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) networks for cancer classification across 31 different cancer types. The proposed approach combines differential gene expression with DESeq2, Linear Models for Microarray (LIMMA), and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression to reduce multi-omics data dimensionality while preserving relevant biological features. The model architecture is based on the Kolmogorov-Arnold theorem principle and uses trainable univariate functions to enhance interpretability and feature analysis. MOGKAN achieves classification accuracy of 96.28 percent and exhibits low experimental variability in comparison to related deep learning-based models. The biomarkers identified by MOGKAN were validated as cancer-related markers through Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis. By integrating multi-omics data with graph-based deep learning, our proposed approach demonstrates robust predictive performance and interpretability with potential to enhance the translation of complex multi-omics data into clinically actionable cancer diagnostics.

Function Fitting Based on Kolmogorov-Arnold Theorem and Kernel Functions,"This paper proposes a unified theoretical framework based on the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem and kernel methods. By analyzing the mathematical relationship among kernels, B-spline basis functions in Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) and the inner product operation in self-attention mechanisms, we establish a kernel-based feature fitting framework that unifies the two models as linear combinations of kernel functions. Under this framework, we propose a low-rank Pseudo-Multi-Head Self-Attention module (Pseudo-MHSA), which reduces the parameter count of traditional MHSA by nearly 50\%. Furthermore, we design a Gaussian kernel multi-head self-attention variant (Gaussian-MHSA) to validate the effectiveness of nonlinear kernel functions in feature extraction. Experiments on the CIFAR-10 dataset demonstrate that Pseudo-MHSA model achieves performance comparable to the ViT model of the same dimensionality under the MAE framework and visualization analysis reveals their similarity of multi-head distribution patterns. Our code is publicly available.

Enhancing Physics-Informed Neural Networks with a Hybrid Parallel Kolmogorov-Arnold and MLP Architecture,"Neural networks have emerged as powerful tools for modeling complex physical systems, yet balancing high accuracy with computational efficiency remains a critical challenge in their convergence behavior. In this work, we propose the Hybrid Parallel Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) Physics-Informed Neural Network (HPKM-PINN), a novel architecture that synergistically integrates parallelized KAN and MLP branches within a unified PINN framework. The HPKM-PINN introduces a scaling factor ξ, to optimally balance the complementary strengths of KAN's interpretable function approximation and MLP's nonlinear feature learning, thereby enhancing predictive performance through a weighted fusion of their outputs. Through systematic numerical evaluations, we elucidate the impact of the scaling factor ξ on the model's performance in both function approximation and partial differential equation (PDE) solving tasks. Benchmark experiments across canonical PDEs, such as the Poisson and Advection equations, demonstrate that HPKM-PINN achieves a marked decrease in loss values (reducing relative error by two orders of magnitude) compared to standalone KAN or MLP models. Furthermore, the framework exhibits numerical stability and robustness when applied to various physical systems. These findings highlight the HPKM-PINN's ability to leverage KAN's interpretability and MLP's expressivity, positioning it as a versatile and scalable tool for solving complex PDE-driven problems in computational science and engineering.

Introducing the Short-Time Fourier Kolmogorov Arnold Network: A Dynamic Graph CNN Approach for Tree Species Classification in 3D Point Clouds,"Accurate classification of tree species based on Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) and Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) is essential for biodiversity conservation. While advanced deep learning models for 3D point cloud classification have demonstrated strong performance in this domain, their high complexity often hinders the development of efficient, low-computation architectures. In this paper, we introduce STFT-KAN, a novel Kolmogorov-Arnold network that integrates the Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT), which can replace the standard linear layer with activation. We implemented STFT-KAN within a lightweight version of DGCNN, called liteDGCNN, to classify tree species using the TLS data. Our experiments show that STFT-KAN outperforms existing KAN variants by effectively balancing model complexity and performance with parameter count reduction, achieving competitive results compared to MLP-based models. Additionally, we evaluated a hybrid architecture that combines MLP in edge convolution with STFT-KAN in other layers, achieving comparable performance to MLP models while reducing the parameter count by 50% and 75% compared to other KAN-based variants. Furthermore, we compared our model to leading 3D point cloud learning approaches, demonstrating that STFT-KAN delivers competitive results compared to the state-of-the-art method PointMLP lite with an 87% reduction in parameter count.

Advancing Cosmological Parameter Estimation and Hubble Parameter Reconstruction with Long Short-Term Memory and Efficient-Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks,"In this work, we propose a novel approach for cosmological parameter estimation and Hubble parameter reconstruction using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Efficient-Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (Ef-KAN). LSTM networks are employed to extract features from observational data, enabling accurate parameter inference and posterior distribution estimation without relying on solvable likelihood functions. This method achieves performance comparable to traditional Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques, offering a computationally efficient alternative for high-dimensional parameter spaces. By sampling from the reconstructed data and comparing it with mock data, our designed LSTM constraint procedure demonstrates the superior performance of this method in terms of constraint accuracy, and effectively captures the degeneracies and correlations between the cosmological parameters. Additionally, the Ef-KAN model is introduced to reconstruct the Hubble parameter H(z) from both observational and mock data. Ef-KAN is entirely data-driven approach, free from prior assumptions, and demonstrates superior capability in modeling complex, non-linear data distributions. We validate the Ef-KAN method by reconstructing the Hubble parameter, demonstrating that H(z) can be reconstructed with high accuracy. By combining LSTM and Ef-KAN, we provide a robust framework for cosmological parameter inference and Hubble parameter reconstruction, paving the way for future research in cosmology, especially when dealing with complex datasets and high-dimensional parameter spaces.

GKAN: Explainable Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease Using Graph Neural Network with Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks,"Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that poses significant diagnostic challenges due to its complex etiology. Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have shown promise in modeling brain connectivity for AD diagnosis, yet their reliance on linear transformations limits their ability to capture intricate nonlinear patterns in neuroimaging data. To address this, we propose GCN-KAN, a novel single-modal framework that integrates Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) into GCNs to enhance both diagnostic accuracy and interpretability. Leveraging structural MRI data, our model employs learnable spline-based transformations to better represent brain region interactions. Evaluated on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset, GCN-KAN outperforms traditional GCNs by 4-8% in classification accuracy while providing interpretable insights into key brain regions associated with AD. This approach offers a robust and explainable tool for early AD diagnosis.

Opening the Black-Box: Symbolic Regression with Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks for Energy Applications,"While most modern machine learning methods offer speed and accuracy, few promise interpretability or explainability -- two key features necessary for highly sensitive industries, like medicine, finance, and engineering. Using eight datasets representative of one especially sensitive industry, nuclear power, this work compares a traditional feedforward neural network (FNN) to a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN). We consider not only model performance and accuracy, but also interpretability through model architecture and explainability through a post-hoc SHAP analysis. In terms of accuracy, we find KANs and FNNs comparable across all datasets, when output dimensionality is limited. KANs, which transform into symbolic equations after training, yield perfectly interpretable models while FNNs remain black-boxes. Finally, using the post-hoc explainability results from Kernel SHAP, we find that KANs learn real, physical relations from experimental data, while FNNs simply produce statistically accurate results. Overall, this analysis finds KANs a promising alternative to traditional machine learning methods, particularly in applications requiring both accuracy and comprehensibility.

DeepOHeat-v1: Efficient Operator Learning for Fast and Trustworthy Thermal Simulation and Optimization in 3D-IC Design,"Thermal analysis is crucial in three-dimensional integrated circuit (3D-IC) design due to increased power density and complex heat dissipation paths. Although operator learning frameworks such as DeepOHeat have demonstrated promising preliminary results in accelerating thermal simulation, they face critical limitations in prediction capability for multi-scale thermal patterns, training efficiency, and trustworthiness of results during design optimization. This paper presents DeepOHeat-v1, an enhanced physics-informed operator learning framework that addresses these challenges through three key innovations. First, we integrate Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks with learnable activation functions as trunk networks, enabling an adaptive representation of multi-scale thermal patterns. This approach achieves a $1.25\times$ and $6.29\times$ reduction in error in two representative test cases. Second, we introduce a separable training method that decomposes the basis function along the coordinate axes, achieving $62\times$ training speedup and $31\times$ GPU memory reduction in our baseline case, and enabling thermal analysis at resolutions previously infeasible due to GPU memory constraints. Third, we propose a confidence score to evaluate the trustworthiness of the predicted results, and further develop a hybrid optimization workflow that combines operator learning with finite difference (FD) using Generalized Minimal Residual (GMRES) method for incremental solution refinement, enabling efficient and trustworthy thermal optimization. Experimental results demonstrate that DeepOHeat-v1 achieves accuracy comparable to optimization using high-fidelity finite difference solvers, while speeding up the entire optimization process by $70.6\times$ in our test cases, effectively minimizing the peak temperature through optimal placement of heat-generating components.

Extending Cox Proportional Hazards Model with Symbolic Non-Linear Log-Risk Functions for Survival Analysis,"The Cox proportional hazards (CPH) model has been widely applied in survival analysis to estimate relative risks across different subjects given multiple covariates. Traditional CPH models rely on a linear combination of covariates weighted with coefficients as the log-risk function, which imposes a strong and restrictive assumption, limiting generalization. Recent deep learning methods enable non-linear log-risk functions. However, they often lack interpretability due to the end-to-end training mechanisms. The implementation of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) offers new possibilities for extending the CPH model with fully transparent and symbolic non-linear log-risk functions. In this paper, we introduce Generalized Cox Proportional Hazards (GCPH) model, a novel method for survival analysis that leverages KAN to enable a non-linear mapping from covariates to survival outcomes in a fully symbolic manner. GCPH maintains the interpretability of traditional CPH models while allowing for the estimation of non-linear log-risk functions. Experiments conducted on both synthetic data and various public benchmarks demonstrate that GCPH achieves competitive performance in terms of prediction accuracy and exhibits superior interpretability compared to current state-of-the-art methods.

asKAN: Active Subspace embedded Kolmogorov-Arnold Network,"The Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) has emerged as a promising neural network architecture for small-scale AI+Science applications. However, it suffers from inflexibility in modeling ridge functions, which is widely used in representing the relationships in physical systems. This study investigates this inflexibility through the lens of the Kolmogorov-Arnold theorem, which starts the representation of multivariate functions from constructing the univariate components rather than combining the independent variables. Our analysis reveals that incorporating linear combinations of independent variables can substantially simplify the network architecture in representing the ridge functions. Inspired by this finding, we propose active subspace embedded KAN (asKAN), a hierarchical framework that synergizes KAN's function representation with active subspace methodology. The architecture strategically embeds active subspace detection between KANs, where the active subspace method is used to identify the primary ridge directions and the independent variables are adaptively projected onto these critical dimensions. The proposed asKAN is implemented in an iterative way without increasing the number of neurons in the original KAN. The proposed method is validated through function fitting, solving the Poisson equation, and reconstructing sound field. Compared with KAN, asKAN significantly reduces the error using the same network architecture. The results suggest that asKAN enhances the capability of KAN in fitting and solving equations in the form of ridge functions.

Furthermore, the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem provides a strong theoretical foundation for the interpretability and optimization of the network. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method through numerical examples, involving both smooth and singular solutions in various dimensions. This work not only addresses the challenges of solving high-dimensional and singular Monge-Ampère equations but also highlights the potential of neural network-based approaches for complex partial differential equations. Additionally, the method is applied to the optimal transport problem in image mapping, showcasing its practical utility in geometric image transformation.

Physics-informed KAN PointNet: Deep learning for simultaneous solutions to inverse problems in incompressible flow on numerous irregular geometries,"Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have gained attention as a promising alternative to traditional Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) for deep learning applications in computational physics, especially within the framework of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). Physics-informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (PIKANs) and their variants have been introduced and evaluated to solve inverse problems. However, similar to PINNs, current versions of PIKANs are limited to obtaining solutions for a single computational domain per training run; consequently, a new geometry requires retraining the model from scratch. Physics-informed PointNet (PIPN) was introduced to address this limitation for PINNs. In this work, we introduce physics-informed Kolmogorov-Arnold PointNet (PI-KAN-PointNet) to extend this capability to PIKANs. PI-KAN-PointNet enables the simultaneous solution of an inverse problem over multiple irregular geometries within a single training run, reducing computational costs. We construct KANs using Jacobi polynomials and investigate their performance by considering Jacobi polynomials of different degrees and types in terms of both computational cost and prediction accuracy. As a benchmark test case, we consider natural convection in a square enclosure with a cylinder, where the cylinder's shape varies across a dataset of 135 geometries. We compare the performance of PI-KAN-PointNet with that of PIPN (i.e., physics-informed PointNet with MLPs) and observe that, with approximately an equal number of trainable parameters and similar computational cost, PI-KAN-PointNet provides more accurate predictions. Finally, we explore the combination of KAN and MLP in constructing a physics-informed PointNet. Our findings indicate that a physics-informed PointNet model employing MLP layers as the encoder and KAN layers as the decoder represents the optimal configuration among all models investigated.

Representation Meets Optimization: Training PINNs and PIKANs for Gray-Box Discovery in Systems Pharmacology,"Physics-Informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (PIKANs) are gaining attention as an effective counterpart to the original multilayer perceptron-based Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). Both representation models can address inverse problems and facilitate gray-box system identification. However, a comprehensive understanding of their performance in terms of accuracy and speed remains underexplored. In particular, we introduce a modified PIKAN architecture, tanh-cPIKAN, which is based on Chebyshev polynomials for parametrization of the univariate functions with an extra nonlinearity for enhanced performance. We then present a systematic investigation of how choices of the optimizer, representation, and training configuration influence the performance of PINNs and PIKANs in the context of systems pharmacology modeling. We benchmark a wide range of first-order, second-order, and hybrid optimizers, including various learning rate schedulers. We use the new Optax library to identify the most effective combinations for learning gray-boxes under ill-posed, non-unique, and data-sparse conditions. We examine the influence of model architecture (MLP vs. KAN), numerical precision (single vs. double), the need for warm-up phases for second-order methods, and sensitivity to the initial learning rate. We also assess the optimizer scalability for larger models and analyze the trade-offs introduced by JAX in terms of computational efficiency and numerical accuracy. Using two representative systems pharmacology case studies - a pharmacokinetics model and a chemotherapy drug-response model - we offer practical guidance on selecting optimizers and representation models/architectures for robust and efficient gray-box discovery. Our findings provide actionable insights for improving the training of physics-informed networks in biomedical applications and beyond.

"A Case for Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks in Prefetching: Towards Low-Latency, Generalizable ML-Based Prefetchers","The memory wall problem arises due to the disparity between fast processors and slower memory, causing significant delays in data access, even more so on edge devices. Data prefetching is a key strategy to address this, with traditional methods evolving to incorporate Machine Learning (ML) for improved accuracy. Modern prefetchers must balance high accuracy with low latency to further practicality. We explore the applicability of utilizing Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) with learnable activation functions,a prefetcher we implemented called KANBoost, to further this aim. KANs are a novel, state-of-the-art model that work on breaking down continuous, bounded multi-variate functions into functions of their constituent variables, and use these constitutent functions as activations on each individual neuron. KANBoost predicts the next memory access by modeling deltas between consecutive addresses, offering a balance of accuracy and efficiency to mitigate the memory wall problem with minimal overhead, instead of relying on address-correlation prefetching. Initial results indicate that KAN-based prefetching reduces inference latency (18X lower than state-of-the-art ML prefetchers) while achieving moderate IPC improvements (2.5\% over no-prefetching). While KANs still face challenges in capturing long-term dependencies, we propose that future research should explore hybrid models that combine KAN efficiency with stronger sequence modeling techniques, paving the way for practical ML-based prefetching in edge devices and beyond.

Motivated by the recent surge in using KAN and graph attention (GAT) architectures in chain-of-thought (CoT) models and debates over their benefits compared to simpler architectures like MLPs, we begin by enhancing a standard self-attention transformer using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), fine-tuning hyperparameters, and incorporating L2 regularization. This approach yields significant improvements. To further boost interpretability and richer representations, we develop two variants that attempt to improve the standard KAN and GAT: Graph LoRA and Hybrid-KAN LoRA (Learnable GPT).

MLPs and KANs for data-driven learning in physical problems: A performance comparison,"There is increasing interest in solving partial differential equations (PDEs) by casting them as machine learning problems. Recently, there has been a spike in exploring Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) as an alternative to traditional neural networks represented by Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs).

Towards Explainable Fusion and Balanced Learning in Multimodal Sentiment Analysis,"Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA) faces two critical challenges: the lack of interpretability in the decision logic of multimodal fusion and modality imbalance caused by disparities in inter-modal information density. To address these issues, we propose KAN-MCP, a novel framework that integrates the interpretability of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) with the robustness of the Multimodal Clean Pareto (MCPareto) framework. First, KAN leverages its univariate function decomposition to achieve transparent analysis of cross-modal interactions. This structural design allows direct inspection of feature transformations without relying on external interpretation tools, thereby ensuring both high expressiveness and interpretability. Second, the proposed MCPareto enhances robustness by addressing modality imbalance and noise interference. Specifically, we introduce the Dimensionality Reduction and Denoising Modal Information Bottleneck (DRD-MIB) method, which jointly denoises and reduces feature dimensionality. This approach provides KAN with discriminative low-dimensional inputs to reduce the modeling complexity of KAN while preserving critical sentiment-related information. Furthermore, MCPareto dynamically balances gradient contributions across modalities using the purified features output by DRD-MIB, ensuring lossless transmission of auxiliary signals and effectively alleviating modality imbalance. This synergy of interpretability and robustness not only achieves superior performance on benchmark datasets such as CMU-MOSI, CMU-MOSEI, and CH-SIMS v2 but also offers an intuitive visualization interface through KAN's interpretable architecture.

Approximation Bounds for Transformer Networks with Application to Regression,"We explore the approximation capabilities of Transformer networks for Hölder and Sobolev functions, and apply these results to address nonparametric regression estimation with dependent observations. First, we establish novel upper bounds for standard Transformer networks approximating sequence-to-sequence mappings whose component functions are Hölder continuous with smoothness index $γ\in (0,1]$. To achieve an approximation error $\varepsilon$ under the $L^p$-norm for $p \in [1, \infty]$, it suffices to use a fixed-depth Transformer network whose total number of parameters scales as $\varepsilon^{-d_x n / γ}$. This result not only extends existing findings to include the case $p = \infty$, but also matches the best known upper bounds on number of parameters previously obtained for fixed-depth FNNs and RNNs. Similar bounds are also derived for Sobolev functions. Second, we derive explicit convergence rates for the nonparametric regression problem under various $β$-mixing data assumptions, which allow the dependence between observations to weaken over time. Our bounds on the sample complexity impose no constraints on weight magnitudes. Lastly, we propose a novel proof strategy to establish approximation bounds, inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem. We show that if the self-attention layer in a Transformer can perform column averaging, the network can approximate sequence-to-sequence Hölder functions, offering new insights into the interpretability of self-attention mechanisms.

ChemKANs for Combustion Chemistry Modeling and Acceleration,"Efficient chemical kinetic model inference and application for combustion problems is challenging due to large ODE systems and wideley separated time scales. Machine learning techniques have been proposed to streamline these models, though strong nonlinearity and numerical stiffness combined with noisy data sources makes their application challenging. The recently developed Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) and KAN ordinary differential equations (KAN-ODEs) have been demonstrated as powerful tools for scientific applications thanks to their rapid neural scaling, improved interpretability, and smooth activation functions. Here, we develop ChemKANs by augmenting the KAN-ODE framework with physical knowledge of the flow of information through the relevant kinetic and thermodynamic laws, as well as an elemental conservation loss term. This novel framework encodes strong inductive bias that enables streamlined training and higher accuracy predictions, while facilitating parameter sparsity through full sharing of information across all inputs and outputs. In a model inference investigation, we find that ChemKANs exhibit no overfitting or model degradation when tasked with extracting predictive models from data that is both sparse and noisy, a task that a standard DeepONet struggles to accomplish. Next, we find that a remarkably parameter-lean ChemKAN (only 344 parameters) can accurately represent hydrogen combustion chemistry, providing a 2x acceleration over the detailed chemistry in a solver that is generalizable to larger-scale turbulent flow simulations. These demonstrations indicate potential for ChemKANs in combustion physics and chemical kinetics, and demonstrate the scalability of generic KAN-ODEs in significantly larger and more numerically challenging problems than previously studied.

Transformers Can Overcome the Curse of Dimensionality: A Theoretical Study from an Approximation Perspective,"The Transformer model is widely used in various application areas of machine learning, such as natural language processing. This paper investigates the approximation of the Hölder continuous function class $\mathcal{H}_{Q}^β\left([0,1]^{d\times n},\mathbb{R}^{d\times n}\right)$ by Transformers and constructs several Transformers that can overcome the curse of dimensionality. These Transformers consist of one self-attention layer with one head and the softmax function as the activation function, along with several feedforward layers. For example, to achieve an approximation accuracy of $ε$, if the activation functions of the feedforward layers in the Transformer are ReLU and floor, only $\mathcal{O}\left(\log\frac{1}ε\right)$ layers of feedforward layers are needed, with widths of these layers not exceeding $\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{ε^{2/β}}\log\frac{1}ε\right)$. If other activation functions are allowed in the feedforward layers, the width of the feedforward layers can be further reduced to a constant. These results demonstrate that Transformers have a strong expressive capability. The construction in this paper is based on the Kolmogorov-Arnold Representation Theorem and does not require the concept of contextual mapping, hence our proof is more intuitively clear compared to previous Transformer approximation works. Additionally, the translation technique proposed in this paper helps to apply the previous approximation results of feedforward neural networks to Transformer research.

Point Cloud Shows the Way Forward,"Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) have become one of the fundamental architectural component in point cloud analysis due to its effective feature learning mechanism. However, when processing complex geometric structures in point clouds, MLPs' fixed activation functions struggle to efficiently capture local geometric features, while suffering from poor parameter efficiency and high model redundancy. In this paper, we propose PointKAN, which applies Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) to point cloud analysis tasks to investigate their efficacy in hierarchical feature representation. First, we introduce a Geometric Affine Module (GAM) to transform local features, improving the model's robustness to geometric variations. Next, in the Local Feature Processing (LFP), a parallel structure extracts both group-level features and global context, providing a rich representation of both fine details and overall structure. Finally, these features are combined and processed in the Global Feature Processing (GFP). By repeating these operations, the receptive field gradually expands, enabling the model to capture complete geometric information of the point cloud. To overcome the high parameter counts and computational inefficiency of standard KANs, we develop Efficient-KANs in the PointKAN-elite variant, which significantly reduces parameters while maintaining accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that PointKAN outperforms PointMLP on benchmark datasets such as ModelNet40, ScanObjectNN, and ShapeNetPart, with particularly strong performance in Few-shot Learning task. Additionally, PointKAN achieves substantial reductions in parameter counts and computational complexity (FLOPs). This work highlights the potential of KANs-based architectures in 3D vision and opens new avenues for research in point cloud understanding.

Efficient Implicit Neural Compression of Point Clouds via Learnable Activation in Latent Space,"Implicit Neural Representations (INRs), also known as neural fields, have emerged as a powerful paradigm in deep learning, parameterizing continuous spatial fields using coordinate-based neural networks. In this paper, we propose \textbf{PICO}, an INR-based framework for static point cloud compression. Unlike prevailing encoder-decoder paradigms, we decompose the point cloud compression task into two separate stages: geometry compression and attribute compression, each with distinct INR optimization objectives. Inspired by Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), we introduce a novel network architecture, \textbf{LeAFNet}, which leverages learnable activation functions in the latent space to better approximate the target signal's implicit function. By reformulating point cloud compression as neural parameter compression, we further improve compression efficiency through quantization and entropy coding. Experimental results demonstrate that \textbf{LeAFNet} outperforms conventional MLPs in INR-based point cloud compression. Furthermore, \textbf{PICO} achieves superior geometry compression performance compared to the current MPEG point cloud compression standard, yielding an average improvement of $4.92$ dB in D1 PSNR. In joint geometry and attribute compression, our approach exhibits highly competitive results, with an average PCQM gain of $2.7 \times 10^{-3}$.

Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks: Approximation and Learning Guarantees for Functions and their Derivatives,"Inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold superposition theorem, Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have recently emerged as an improved backbone for most deep learning frameworks, promising more adaptivity than their multilayer perception (MLP) predecessor by allowing for trainable spline-based activation functions. In this paper, we probe the theoretical foundations of the KAN architecture by showing that it can optimally approximate any Besov function in $B^{s}_{p,q}(\mathcal{X})$ on a bounded open, or even fractal, domain $\mathcal{X}$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$ at the optimal approximation rate with respect to any weaker Besov norm $B^α_{p,q}(\mathcal{X})$; where $α< s$. We complement our approximation guarantee with a dimension-free estimate on the sample complexity of a residual KAN model when learning a function of Besov regularity from $N$ i.i.d. noiseless samples. Our KAN architecture incorporates contemporary deep learning wisdom by leveraging residual/skip connections between layers.

Conformalized-KANs: Uncertainty Quantification with Coverage Guarantees for Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) in Scientific Machine Learning,"This paper explores uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods in the context of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs).

Building on this, we introduce Conformalized-KANs, which integrate conformal prediction, a distribution-free UQ technique, with KAN ensembles to generate calibrated prediction intervals with guaranteed coverage. Extensive numerical experiments are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of these methods, focusing particularly on the robustness and accuracy of the prediction intervals under various hyperparameter settings. We show that the conformal KAN predictions can be applied to recent extensions of KANs, including Finite Basis KANs (FBKANs) and multifideilty KANs (MFKANs). The results demonstrate the potential of our approaches to improve the reliability and applicability of KANs in scientific machine learning.

DAE-KAN: A Kolmogorov-Arnold Network Model for High-Index Differential-Algebraic Equations,"Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have emerged as a promising alternative to Multi-layer Perceptrons (MLPs) due to their superior function-fitting abilities in data-driven modeling. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, DAE-KAN, for solving high-index differential-algebraic equations (DAEs) by integrating KANs with Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). This framework not only preserves the ability of traditional PINNs to model complex systems governed by physical laws but also enhances their performance by leveraging the function-fitting strengths of KANs. Numerical experiments demonstrate that for DAE systems ranging from index-1 to index-3, DAE-KAN reduces the absolute errors of both differential and algebraic variables by 1 to 2 orders of magnitude compared to traditional PINNs. To assess the effectiveness of this approach, we analyze the drift-off error and find that both PINNs and DAE-KAN outperform classical numerical methods in controlling this phenomenon. Our results highlight the potential of neural network methods, particularly DAE-KAN, in solving high-index DAEs with substantial computational accuracy and generalization, offering a promising solution for challenging partial differential-algebraic equations.

FiberKAN: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks for Nonlinear Fiber Optics,"Scientific discovery and dynamic characterization of the physical system play a critical role in understanding, learning, and modeling the physical phenomena and behaviors in various fields. Although theories and laws of many system dynamics have been derived from rigorous first principles, there are still a considerable number of complex dynamics that have not yet been discovered and characterized, which hinders the progress of science in corresponding fields. To address these challenges, artificial intelligence for science (AI4S) has emerged as a burgeoning research field. In this paper, a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN)-based AI4S framework named FiberKAN is proposed for scientific discovery and dynamic characterization of nonlinear fiber optics. Unlike the classic multi-layer perceptron (MLP) structure, the trainable and transparent activation functions in KAN make the network have stronger physical interpretability and nonlinear characterization abilities. Multiple KANs are established for fiber-optic system dynamics under various physical effects. Results show that KANs can well discover and characterize the explicit, implicit, and non-analytical solutions under different effects, and achieve better performance than MLPs with the equivalent scale of trainable parameters. Moreover, the effectiveness, computational cost, interactivity, noise resistance, transfer learning ability, and comparison between related algorithms in fiber-optic systems are also studied and analyzed. This work highlights the transformative potential of KAN, establishing it as a pioneering paradigm in AI4S that propels advancements in nonlinear fiber optics, and fosters groundbreaking innovations across a broad spectrum of scientific and engineering disciplines.

A Unified Benchmark of Federated Learning with Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks for Medical Imaging,"Federated Learning (FL) enables model training across decentralized devices without sharing raw data, thereby preserving privacy in sensitive domains like healthcare. In this paper, we evaluate Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) architectures against traditional MLP across six state-of-the-art FL algorithms on a blood cell classification dataset. Notably, our experiments demonstrate that KAN can effectively replace MLP in federated environments, achieving superior performance with simpler architectures. Furthermore, we analyze the impact of key hyperparameters-grid size and network architecture-on KAN performance under varying degrees of Non-IID data distribution. Additionally, our ablation studies reveal that optimizing KAN width while maintaining minimal depth yields the best performance in federated settings. As a result, these findings establish KAN as a promising alternative for privacy-preserving medical imaging applications in distributed healthcare.

Anant-Net: Breaking the Curse of Dimensionality with Scalable and Interpretable Neural Surrogate for High-Dimensional PDEs,"High-dimensional partial differential equations (PDEs) arise in diverse scientific and engineering applications but remain computationally intractable due to the curse of dimensionality. Traditional numerical methods struggle with the exponential growth in computational complexity, particularly on hypercubic domains, where the number of required collocation points increases rapidly with dimensionality. Here, we introduce Anant-Net, an efficient neural surrogate that overcomes this challenge, enabling the solution of PDEs in high dimensions. Unlike hyperspheres, where the internal volume diminishes as dimensionality increases, hypercubes retain or expand their volume (for unit or larger length), making high-dimensional computations significantly more demanding. Anant-Net efficiently incorporates high-dimensional boundary conditions and minimizes the PDE residual at high-dimensional collocation points. To enhance interpretability, we integrate Kolmogorov-Arnold networks into the Anant-Net architecture. We benchmark Anant-Net's performance on several linear and nonlinear high-dimensional equations, including the Poisson, Sine-Gordon, and Allen-Cahn equations, demonstrating high accuracy and robustness across randomly sampled test points from high-dimensional space. Importantly, Anant-Net achieves these results with remarkable efficiency, solving 300-dimensional problems on a single GPU within a few hours. We also compare Anant-Net's results for accuracy and runtime with other state-of-the-art methods. Our findings establish Anant-Net as an accurate, interpretable, and scalable framework for efficiently solving high-dimensional PDEs.

Novel Extraction of Discriminative Fine-Grained Feature to Improve Retinal Vessel Segmentation,"Retinal vessel segmentation is a vital early detection method for several severe ocular diseases. Despite significant progress in retinal vessel segmentation with the advancement of Neural Networks, there are still challenges to overcome. Specifically, retinal vessel segmentation aims to predict the class label for every pixel within a fundus image, with a primary focus on intra-image discrimination, making it vital for models to extract more discriminative features. Nevertheless, existing methods primarily focus on minimizing the difference between the output from the decoder and the label, but ignore fully using feature-level fine-grained representations from the encoder. To address these issues, we propose a novel Attention U-shaped Kolmogorov-Arnold Network named AttUKAN along with a novel Label-guided Pixel-wise Contrastive Loss for retinal vessel segmentation. Specifically, we implement Attention Gates into Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks to enhance model sensitivity by suppressing irrelevant feature activations and model interpretability by non-linear modeling of KAN blocks. Additionally, we also design a novel Label-guided Pixel-wise Contrastive Loss to supervise our proposed AttUKAN to extract more discriminative features by distinguishing between foreground vessel-pixel pairs and background pairs. Experiments are conducted across four public datasets including DRIVE, STARE, CHASE_DB1, HRF and our private dataset. AttUKAN achieves F1 scores of 82.50%, 81.14%, 81.34%, 80.21% and 80.09%, along with MIoU scores of 70.24%, 68.64%, 68.59%, 67.21% and 66.94% in the above datasets, which are the highest compared to 11 networks for retinal vessel segmentation. Quantitative and qualitative results show that our AttUKAN achieves state-of-the-art performance and outperforms existing retinal vessel segmentation methods.

These modules are systematically integrated in ViT encoder layers and classification heads to enhance spatial-frequency modeling while mitigating computational bottlenecks. Experiments on ImageNet-1K (Image Recognition), COCO (Object Detection and Instance Segmentation), and ADE20K (Semantic Segmentation) demonstrate state-of-the-art performance with Hyb-KAN ViT.

Prediction via Shapley Value Regression,"Shapley values have several desirable, theoretically well-supported, properties for explaining black-box model predictions. Traditionally, Shapley values are computed post-hoc, leading to additional computational cost at inference time. To overcome this, a novel method, called ViaSHAP, is proposed, that learns a function to compute Shapley values, from which the predictions can be derived directly by summation. Two approaches to implement the proposed method are explored; one based on the universal approximation theorem and the other on the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem. Results from a large-scale empirical investigation are presented, showing that ViaSHAP using Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks performs on par with state-of-the-art algorithms for tabular data. It is also shown that the explanations of ViaSHAP are significantly more accurate than the popular approximator FastSHAP on both tabular data and images.

OccuEMBED: Occupancy Extraction Merged with Building Energy Disaggregation for Occupant-Responsive Operation at Scale,"Buildings account for a significant share of global energy consumption and emissions, making it critical to operate them efficiently. As electricity grids become more volatile with renewable penetration, buildings must provide flexibility to support grid stability. Building automation plays a key role in enhancing efficiency and flexibility via centralized operations, but it must prioritize occupant-centric strategies to balance energy and comfort targets. However, incorporating occupant information into large-scale, centralized building operations remains challenging due to data limitations. We investigate the potential of using whole-building smart meter data to infer both occupancy and system operations. Integrating these insights into data-driven building energy analysis allows more occupant-centric energy-saving and flexibility at scale. Specifically, we propose OccuEMBED, a unified framework for occupancy inference and system-level load analysis. It combines two key components: a probabilistic occupancy profile generator, and a controllable and interpretable load disaggregator supported by Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN). This design embeds knowledge of occupancy patterns and load-occupancy-weather relationships into deep learning models. We conducted comprehensive evaluations to demonstrate its effectiveness across synthetic and real-world datasets compared to various occupancy inference baselines. OccuEMBED always achieved average F1 scores above 0.8 in discrete occupancy inference and RMSE within 0.1-0.2 for continuous occupancy ratios. We further demonstrate how OccuEMBED integrates with building load monitoring platforms to display occupancy profiles, analyze system-level operations, and inform occupant-responsive strategies. Our model lays a robust foundation in scaling occupant-centric building management systems to meet the challenges of an evolving energy system.

KANs exhibit remarkable robustness under varying client numbers and non-IID data distributions, maintaining superior performance even as client heterogeneity increases. Notably, KANs require fewer communication rounds to converge compared to MLPs, highlighting their efficiency in FL scenarios. Additionally, we evaluate multiple parameter aggregation strategies, with trimmed mean and FedProx emerging as the most effective for optimizing KAN performance. These findings establish KANs as a robust and scalable alternative to MLPs for federated learning tasks, paving the way for their application in decentralized and privacy-preserving environments.

Symbolic Regression with Multimodal Large Language Models and Kolmogorov Arnold Networks,"We present a novel approach to symbolic regression using vision-capable large language models (LLMs) and the ideas behind Google DeepMind's Funsearch. The LLM is given a plot of a univariate function and tasked with proposing an ansatz for that function. The free parameters of the ansatz are fitted using standard numerical optimisers, and a collection of such ansätze make up the population of a genetic algorithm. Unlike other symbolic regression techniques, our method does not require the specification of a set of functions to be used in regression, but with appropriate prompt engineering, we can arbitrarily condition the generative step. By using Kolmogorov Arnold Networks (KANs), we demonstrate that ``univariate is all you need'' for symbolic regression, and extend this method to multivariate functions by learning the univariate function on each edge of a trained KAN. The combined expression is then simplified by further processing with a language model.

AC-PKAN: Attention-Enhanced and Chebyshev Polynomial-Based Physics-Informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks,"Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have recently shown promise for solving partial differential equations (PDEs). Yet their original formulation is computationally and memory intensive, motivating the introduction of Chebyshev Type-I-based KANs (Chebyshev1KANs). Although Chebyshev1KANs have outperformed the vanilla KANs architecture, our rigorous theoretical analysis reveals that they still suffer from rank collapse, ultimately limiting their expressive capacity. To overcome these limitations, we enhance Chebyshev1KANs by integrating wavelet-activated MLPs with learnable parameters and an internal attention mechanism. We prove that this design preserves a full-rank Jacobian and is capable of approximating solutions to PDEs of arbitrary order. Furthermore, to alleviate the loss instability and imbalance introduced by the Chebyshev polynomial basis, we externally incorporate a Residual Gradient Attention (RGA) mechanism that dynamically re-weights individual loss terms according to their gradient norms and residual magnitudes. By jointly leveraging internal and external attention, we present AC-PKAN, a novel architecture that constitutes an enhancement to weakly supervised Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and extends the expressive power of KANs. Experimental results from nine benchmark tasks across three domains show that AC-PKAN consistently outperforms or matches state-of-the-art models such as PINNsFormer, establishing it as a highly effective tool for solving complex real-world engineering problems in zero-data or data-sparse regimes.

Personalized Control for Lower Limb Prosthesis Using Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks,"Objective: This paper investigates the potential of learnable activation functions in Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) for personalized control in a lower-limb prosthesis. In addition, user-specific vs. pooled training data is evaluated to improve machine learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) performance for turn intent prediction.
  Method: Inertial measurement unit (IMU) data from the shank were collected from five individuals with lower-limb amputation performing turning tasks in a laboratory setting. Ability to classify an upcoming turn was evaluated for Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN), convolutional neural network (CNN), and fractional Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (FKAN). The comparison of MLP and KAN (for ML models) and FKAN and CNN (for DL models) assessed the effectiveness of learnable activation functions. Models were trained separately on user-specific and pooled data to evaluate the impact of training data on their performance.
  Results: Learnable activation functions in KAN and FKAN did not yield significant improvement compared to MLP and CNN, respectively. Training on user-specific data yielded superior results compared to pooled data for ML models ($p < 0.05$). In contrast, no significant difference was observed between user-specific and pooled training for DL models.
  Significance: These findings suggest that learnable activation functions may demonstrate distinct advantages in datasets involving more complex tasks and larger volumes. In addition, pooled training showed comparable performance to user-specific training in DL models, indicating that model training for prosthesis control can utilize data from multiple participants.

These formulas not only retain the full predictive power of the network but also enable deterministic inverse design. Applying them, we generate 2,000 photonic crystals with target band symmetries, achieving over 92% accuracy even for high-contrast, experimentally realizable structures beyond the training domain.

"KHRONOS: a Kernel-Based Neural Architecture for Rapid, Resource-Efficient Scientific Computation","Contemporary models of high dimensional physical systems are constrained by the curse of dimensionality and a reliance on dense data. We introduce KHRONOS (Kernel Expansion Hierarchy for Reduced Order, Neural Optimized Surrogates), an AI framework for model based, model free and model inversion tasks. KHRONOS constructs continuously differentiable target fields with a hierarchical composition of per-dimension kernel expansions, which are tensorized into modes and then superposed. We evaluate KHRONOS on a canonical 2D, Poisson equation benchmark: across 16 to 512 degrees of freedom (DoFs), it obtained L_2-square errors of 5e-4 down to 6e-11. This represents a greater than 100-fold gain over Kolmogorov Arnold Networks (which itself reports a 100 times improvement on MLPs/PINNs with 100 times fewer parameters) when controlling for the number of parameters. This also represents a 1e6-fold improvement in L_2-square error compared to standard linear FEM at comparable DoFs. Inference complexity is dominated by inner products, yielding sub-millisecond full-field predictions that scale to an arbitrary resolution. For inverse problems, KHRONOS facilitates rapid, iterative level set recovery in only a few forward evaluations, with sub-microsecond per sample latency. KHRONOS's scalability, expressivity, and interpretability open new avenues in constrained edge computing, online control, computer vision, and beyond.

FlashKAT: Understanding and Addressing Performance Bottlenecks in the Kolmogorov-Arnold Transformer,"The Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) has been gaining popularity as an alternative to the multi-layer perceptron (MLP) with its increased expressiveness and interpretability. However, the KAN can be orders of magnitude slower due to its increased computational cost and training instability, limiting its applicability to larger-scale tasks. Recently, the Kolmogorov-Arnold Transformer (KAT) has been proposed, which can achieve FLOPs similar to the traditional Transformer with MLPs by leveraging Group-Rational KAN (GR-KAN). Unfortunately, despite the comparable FLOPs, our characterizations reveal that the KAT is still 123x slower in training speeds, indicating that there are other performance bottlenecks beyond FLOPs. In this paper, we conduct a series of experiments to understand the root cause of the slowdown in KAT. We uncover that the slowdown can be isolated to memory stalls and, more specifically, in the backward pass of GR-KAN caused by inefficient gradient accumulation. To address this memory bottleneck, we propose FlashKAT, which builds on our restructured kernel that minimizes gradient accumulation with atomic adds and accesses to slow memory. Evaluations demonstrate that FlashKAT can achieve a training speedup of 86.5x compared with the state-of-the-art KAT, while reducing rounding errors in the coefficient gradients.

Our experimental results on artificial test functions and real-world datasets demonstrate that X-KAN significantly outperforms conventional methods, including XCSF, Multi-Layer Perceptron, and KAN, in terms of approximation accuracy. Notably, X-KAN effectively handles functions with locally complex or discontinuous structures that are challenging for conventional KAN, using a compact set of rules (average 7.2 $\pm$ 2.3 rules). These results validate the effectiveness of using KAN as a local model in XCSF, which evaluates the rule fitness based on both accuracy and generality. Our X-KAN implementation is available at https://github.com/YNU-NakataLab/X-KAN.

Interpretable Reinforcement Learning for Load Balancing using Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks,"Reinforcement learning (RL) has been increasingly applied to network control problems, such as load balancing. However, existing RL approaches often suffer from lack of interpretability and difficulty in extracting controller equations. In this paper, we propose the use of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) for interpretable RL in network control. We employ a PPO agent with a 1-layer actor KAN model and an MLP Critic network to learn load balancing policies that maximise throughput utility, minimize loss as well as delay. Our approach allows us to extract controller equations from the learned neural networks, providing insights into the decision-making process. We evaluate our approach using different reward functions demonstrating its effectiveness in improving network performance while providing interpretable policies.

Khan-GCL: Kolmogorov-Arnold Network Based Graph Contrastive Learning with Hard Negatives,"Graph contrastive learning (GCL) has demonstrated great promise for learning generalizable graph representations from unlabeled data. However, conventional GCL approaches face two critical limitations: (1) the restricted expressive capacity of multilayer perceptron (MLP) based encoders, and (2) suboptimal negative samples that either from random augmentations-failing to provide effective 'hard negatives'-or generated hard negatives without addressing the semantic distinctions crucial for discriminating graph data. To this end, we propose Khan-GCL, a novel framework that integrates the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) into the GCL encoder architecture, substantially enhancing its representational capacity. Furthermore, we exploit the rich information embedded within KAN coefficient parameters to develop two novel critical feature identification techniques that enable the generation of semantically meaningful hard negative samples for each graph representation. These strategically constructed hard negatives guide the encoder to learn more discriminative features by emphasizing critical semantic differences between graphs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing GCL methods across a variety of datasets and tasks.

Degree-Optimized Cumulative Polynomial Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks,"We introduce cumulative polynomial Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (CP-KAN), a neural architecture combining Chebyshev polynomial basis functions and quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO). Our primary contribution involves reformulating the degree selection problem as a QUBO task, reducing the complexity from $O(D^N)$ to a single optimization step per layer. This approach enables efficient degree selection across neurons while maintaining computational tractability. The architecture performs well in regression tasks with limited data, showing good robustness to input scales and natural regularization properties from its polynomial basis. Additionally, theoretical analysis establishes connections between CP-KAN's performance and properties of financial time series. Our empirical validation across multiple domains demonstrates competitive performance compared to several traditional architectures tested, especially in scenarios where data efficiency and numerical stability are important. Our implementation, including strategies for managing computational overhead in larger networks is available in Ref.~\citep{cpkan_implementation}.

Leveraging KANs for Expedient Training of Multichannel MLPs via Preconditioning and Geometric Refinement,"Multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) are a workhorse machine learning architecture, used in a variety of modern deep learning frameworks. However, recently Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have become increasingly popular due to their success on a range of problems, particularly for scientific machine learning tasks. In this paper, we exploit the relationship between KANs and multichannel MLPs to gain structural insight into how to train MLPs faster. We demonstrate the KAN basis (1) provides geometric localized support, and (2) acts as a preconditioned descent in the ReLU basis, overall resulting in expedited training and improved accuracy. Our results show the equivalence between free-knot spline KAN architectures, and a class of MLPs that are refined geometrically along the channel dimension of each weight tensor. We exploit this structural equivalence to define a hierarchical refinement scheme that dramatically accelerates training of the multi-channel MLP architecture. We show further accuracy improvements can be had by allowing the $1$D locations of the spline knots to be trained simultaneously with the weights. These advances are demonstrated on a range of benchmark examples for regression and scientific machine learning.

COLORA: Efficient Fine-Tuning for Convolutional Models with a Study Case on Optical Coherence Tomography Image Classification,"We introduce the Convolutional Low-Rank Adaptation (CoLoRA) method, designed explicitly to overcome the inefficiencies found in current CNN fine-tuning methods. CoLoRA can be seen as a natural extension of the convolutional architectures of the Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) technique. We demonstrate the capabilities of our method by developing and evaluating models using the widely adopted CNN backbone pre-trained on ImageNet. We observed that this strategy results in a stable and accurate coarse-tuning procedure. Moreover, this strategy is computationally efficient and significantly reduces the number of parameters required for fine-tuning compared to traditional methods. Furthermore, our method substantially improves the speed and stability of training. Our case study focuses on classifying retinal diseases from optical coherence tomography (OCT) images, specifically using the OCTMNIST dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that a CNN backbone fine-tuned with CoLoRA surpasses nearly 1\% in accuracy. Such a performance is comparable to the Vision Transformer, State-space discrete, and Kolmogorov-Arnold network models.

TK-Mamba: Marrying KAN with Mamba for Text-Driven 3D Medical Image Segmentation,"3D medical image segmentation is vital for clinical diagnosis and treatment but is challenged by high-dimensional data and complex spatial dependencies. Traditional single-modality networks, such as CNNs and Transformers, are often limited by computational inefficiency and constrained contextual modeling in 3D settings. We introduce a novel multimodal framework that leverages Mamba and Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) as an efficient backbone for long-sequence modeling. Our approach features three key innovations: First, an EGSC (Enhanced Gated Spatial Convolution) module captures spatial information when unfolding 3D images into 1D sequences. Second, we extend Group-Rational KAN (GR-KAN), a Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks variant with rational basis functions, into 3D-Group-Rational KAN (3D-GR-KAN) for 3D medical imaging - its first application in this domain - enabling superior feature representation tailored to volumetric data. Third, a dual-branch text-driven strategy leverages CLIP's text embeddings: one branch swaps one-hot labels for semantic vectors to preserve inter-organ semantic relationships, while the other aligns images with detailed organ descriptions to enhance semantic alignment. Experiments on the Medical Segmentation Decathlon (MSD) and KiTS23 datasets show our method achieving state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing approaches in accuracy and efficiency. This work highlights the power of combining advanced sequence modeling, extended network architectures, and vision-language synergy to push forward 3D medical image segmentation, delivering a scalable solution for clinical use.

Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks for Turbulence Anisotropy Mapping,"This study evaluates the generalization performance and representation efficiency (parsimony) of a previously introduced Tensor Basis Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (TBKAN) architecture for data-driven turbulence modeling. The TBKAN framework replaces the multi-layer perceptron (MLP) used in either the standard or modified Tensor Basis Neural Network (TBNN) with a Kolmogorov-Arnold network (KAN), which significantly reduces the model complexity while providing a structure that potentially can be used with symbolic regression to provide a physical interpretability that is not available in a 'black box' MLP. While some prior work demonstrated TBKAN's feasibility for modeling a 'simple' flat plate boundary layer flow, this study extends the TBKAN architecture to model more complex benchmark flows, in particular, square duct and periodic hills flows which exhibit strong turbulence anisotropy, secondary motion, and flow separation and reattachment. A realizability-informed loss function is employed to constrain the model predictions, and, for the first time, TBKAN predictions are stably injected into the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations to provide it a posteriori predictions of the mean velocity field.

"""KAN you hear me?"" Exploring Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks for Spoken Language Understanding","Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have recently emerged as a promising alternative to traditional neural architectures, yet their application to speech processing remains under explored. This work presents the first investigation of KANs for Spoken Language Understanding (SLU) tasks. We experiment with 2D-CNN models on two datasets, integrating KAN layers in five different configurations within the dense block. The best-performing setup, which places a KAN layer between two linear layers, is directly applied to transformer-based models and evaluated on five SLU datasets with increasing complexity. Our results show that KAN layers can effectively replace the linear layers, achieving comparable or superior performance in most cases. Finally, we provide insights into how KAN and linear layers on top of transformers differently attend to input regions of the raw waveforms.

"FMEnets: Flow, Material, and Energy networks for non-ideal plug flow reactor design","We propose FMEnets, a physics-informed machine learning framework for the design and analysis of non-ideal plug flow reactors. FMEnets integrates the fundamental governing equations (Navier-Stokes for fluid flow, material balance for reactive species transport, and energy balance for temperature distribution) into a unified multi-scale network model. The framework is composed of three interconnected sub-networks with independent optimizers that enable both forward and inverse problem-solving. In the forward mode, FMEnets predicts velocity, pressure, species concentrations, and temperature profiles using only inlet and outlet information. In the inverse mode, FMEnets utilizes sparse multi-residence-time measurements to simultaneously infer unknown kinetic parameters and states. FMEnets can be implemented either as FME-PINNs, which employ conventional multilayer perceptrons, or as FME-KANs, based on Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks. Comprehensive ablation studies highlight the critical role of the FMEnets architecture in achieving accurate predictions. Specifically, FME-KANs are more robust to noise than FME-PINNs, although both representations are comparable in accuracy and speed in noise-free conditions. The proposed framework is applied to three different sets of reaction scenarios and is compared with finite element simulations. FMEnets effectively captures the complex interactions, achieving relative errors less than 2.5% for the unknown kinetic parameters. The new network framework not only provides a computationally efficient alternative for reactor design and optimization, but also opens new avenues for integrating empirical correlations, limited and noisy experimental data, and fundamental physical equations to guide reactor design.

Two specific networks are presented: the first is based on a low-order, linear-by-part, representation of functions, and a universal approximation theorem is provided. The second is based on cubic splines, for which only numerical results support convergence. We demonstrate on simple tests that these networks perform competitively with classical input convex neural networks (ICNNs). In a second part, we use the networks to solve some optimal transport problems needing a convex approximation of functions and demonstrate their effectiveness. Comparisons with ICNNs show that cubic ICKANs produce results similar to those of classical ICNNs.

Taylor expansion-based Kolmogorov-Arnold network for blind image quality assessment,"Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) has attracted growing interest for its strong function approximation capability. In our previous work, KAN and its variants were explored in score regression for blind image quality assessment (BIQA). However, these models encounter challenges when processing high-dimensional features, leading to limited performance gains and increased computational cost. To address these issues, we propose TaylorKAN that leverages the Taylor expansions as learnable activation functions to enhance local approximation capability. To improve the computational efficiency, network depth reduction and feature dimensionality compression are integrated into the TaylorKAN-based score regression pipeline. On five databases (BID, CLIVE, KonIQ, SPAQ, and FLIVE) with authentic distortions, extensive experiments demonstrate that TaylorKAN consistently outperforms the other KAN-related models, indicating that the local approximation via Taylor expansions is more effective than global approximation using orthogonal functions. Its generalization capacity is validated through inter-database experiments. The findings highlight the potential of TaylorKAN as an efficient and robust model for high-dimensional score regression.

Localized Weather Prediction Using Kolmogorov-Arnold Network-Based Models and Deep RNNs,"Weather forecasting is crucial for managing risks and economic planning, particularly in tropical Africa, where extreme events severely impact livelihoods. Yet, existing forecasting methods often struggle with the region's complex, non-linear weather patterns. This study benchmarks deep recurrent neural networks such as $\texttt{LSTM, GRU, BiLSTM, BiGRU}$, and Kolmogorov-Arnold-based models $(\texttt{KAN} and \texttt{TKAN})$ for daily forecasting of temperature, precipitation, and pressure in two tropical cities: Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire (Ivory Coast) and Kigali (Rwanda). We further introduce two customized variants of $ \texttt{TKAN}$ that replace its original $\texttt{SiLU}$ activation function with $ \texttt{GeLU}$ and \texttt{MiSH}, respectively. Using station-level meteorological data spanning from 2010 to 2024, we evaluate all the models on standard regression metrics. $\texttt{KAN}$ achieves temperature prediction ($R^2=0.9986$ in Abidjan, $0.9998$ in Kigali, $\texttt{MSE} < 0.0014~^\circ C ^2$), while $\texttt{TKAN}$ variants minimize absolute errors for precipitation forecasting in low-rainfall regimes. The customized $\texttt{TKAN}$ models demonstrate improvements over the standard $\texttt{TKAN}$ across both datasets. Classical \texttt{RNNs} remain highly competitive for atmospheric pressure ($R^2 \approx 0.83{-}0.86$), outperforming $\texttt{KAN}$-based models in this task. These results highlight the potential of spline-based neural architectures for efficient and data-efficient forecasting.

Automated Modeling Method for Pathloss Model Discovery,"Modeling propagation is the cornerstone for designing and optimizing next-generation wireless systems, with a particular emphasis on 5G and beyond era. Traditional modeling methods have long relied on statistic-based techniques to characterize propagation behavior across different environments. With the expansion of wireless communication systems, there is a growing demand for methods that guarantee the accuracy and interpretability of modeling. Artificial intelligence (AI)-based techniques, in particular, are increasingly being adopted to overcome this challenge, although the interpretability is not assured with most of these methods. Inspired by recent advancements in AI, this paper proposes a novel approach that accelerates the discovery of path loss models while maintaining interpretability. The proposed method automates the formulation, evaluation, and refinement of the model, facilitating the discovery of the model. We examine two techniques: one based on Deep Symbolic Regression, offering full interpretability, and the second based on Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks, providing two levels of interpretability. Both approaches are evaluated on two synthetic and two real-world datasets. Our results show that Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks achieve the coefficient of determination value R^2 close to 1 with minimal prediction error, while Deep Symbolic Regression generates compact models with moderate accuracy. Moreover, on the selected examples, we demonstrate that automated methods outperform traditional methods, achieving up to 75% reduction in prediction errors, offering accurate and explainable solutions with potential to increase the efficiency of discovering next-generation path loss models.

SPPSFormer: High-quality Superpoint-based Transformer for Roof Plane Instance Segmentation from Point Clouds,"Transformers have been seldom employed in point cloud roof plane instance segmentation, which is the focus of this study, and existing superpoint Transformers suffer from limited performance due to the use of low-quality superpoints. To address this challenge, we establish two criteria that high-quality superpoints for Transformers should satisfy and introduce a corresponding two-stage superpoint generation process. The superpoints generated by our method not only have accurate boundaries, but also exhibit consistent geometric sizes and shapes, both of which greatly benefit the feature learning of superpoint Transformers. To compensate for the limitations of deep learning features when the training set size is limited, we incorporate multidimensional handcrafted features into the model. Additionally, we design a decoder that combines a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network with a Transformer module to improve instance prediction and mask extraction. Finally, our network's predictions are refined using traditional algorithm-based postprocessing. For evaluation, we annotated a real-world dataset and corrected annotation errors in the existing RoofN3D dataset. Experimental results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on our dataset, as well as both the original and reannotated RoofN3D datasets. Moreover, our model is not sensitive to plane boundary annotations during training, significantly reducing the annotation burden. Through comprehensive experiments, we also identified key factors influencing roof plane segmentation performance: in addition to roof types, variations in point cloud density, density uniformity, and 3D point precision have a considerable impact. These findings underscore the importance of incorporating data augmentation strategies that account for point cloud quality to enhance model robustness under diverse and challenging conditions.

How can AI reduce fall injuries in the workplace?,"Fall-caused injuries are common in all types of work environments, including offices. They are the main cause of absences longer than three days, especially for small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs). However, data, data amount, data heterogeneity, and stringent processing time constraints continue to pose challenges to real-time fall detection.

The approach is tested on SisFall, a dataset consisting of 2706 Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) and 1798 falls recorded by three sensors. The results show that the proposed approach achieves an average TPR of 82.6% and TNR of 98.4% for fall sequences and 94.4% in ADL. Besides, the Root Mean Squared Error of the estimated time of impact is approximately 160ms.

Multi-Exit Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks: enhancing accuracy and parsimony,"Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) uniquely combine high accuracy with interpretability, making them valuable for scientific modeling. However, it is unclear a priori how deep a network needs to be for any given task, and deeper KANs can be difficult to optimize. Here we introduce multi-exit KANs, where each layer includes its own prediction branch, enabling the network to make accurate predictions at multiple depths simultaneously. This architecture provides deep supervision that improves training while discovering the right level of model complexity for each task. Multi-exit KANs consistently outperform standard, single-exit versions on synthetic functions, dynamical systems, and real-world datasets. Remarkably, the best predictions often come from earlier, simpler exits, revealing that these networks naturally identify smaller, more parsimonious and interpretable models without sacrificing accuracy. To automate this discovery, we develop a differentiable ""learning to exit"" algorithm that balances contributions from exits during training. Our approach offers scientists a practical way to achieve both high performance and interpretability, addressing a fundamental challenge in machine learning for scientific discovery.

Improving Memory Efficiency for Training KANs via Meta Learning,"Inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, KANs offer a novel framework for function approximation by replacing traditional neural network weights with learnable univariate functions. This design demonstrates significant potential as an efficient and interpretable alternative to traditional MLPs. However, KANs are characterized by a substantially larger number of trainable parameters, leading to challenges in memory efficiency and higher training costs compared to MLPs. To address this limitation, we propose to generate weights for KANs via a smaller meta-learner, called MetaKANs. By training KANs and MetaKANs in an end-to-end differentiable manner, MetaKANs achieve comparable or even superior performance while significantly reducing the number of trainable parameters and maintaining promising interpretability. Extensive experiments on diverse benchmark tasks, including symbolic regression, partial differential equation solving, and image classification, demonstrate the effectiveness of MetaKANs in improving parameter efficiency and memory usage. The proposed method provides an alternative technique for training KANs, that allows for greater scalability and extensibility, and narrows the training cost gap with MLPs stated in the original paper of KANs.

Neural Tangent Kernel Analysis to Probe Convergence in Physics-informed Neural Solvers: PIKANs vs. PINNs,"Physics-informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (PIKANs), and in particular their Chebyshev-based variants (cPIKANs), have recently emerged as promising models for solving partial differential equations (PDEs). However, their training dynamics and convergence behavior remain largely unexplored both theoretically and numerically. In this work, we aim to advance the theoretical understanding of cPIKANs by analyzing them using Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) theory. Our objective is to discern the evolution of kernel structure throughout gradient-based training and its subsequent impact on learning efficiency. We first derive the NTK of standard cKANs in a supervised setting, and then extend the analysis to the physics-informed context. We analyze the spectral properties of NTK matrices, specifically their eigenvalue distributions and spectral bias, for four representative PDEs: the steady-state Helmholtz equation, transient diffusion and Allen-Cahn equations, and forced vibrations governed by the Euler-Bernoulli beam equation. We also conduct an investigation into the impact of various optimization strategies, e.g., first-order, second-order, and hybrid approaches, on the evolution of the NTK and the resulting learning dynamics. Results indicate a tractable behavior for NTK in the context of cPIKANs, which exposes learning dynamics that standard physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) cannot capture. Spectral trends also reveal when domain decomposition improves training, directly linking kernel behavior to convergence rates under different setups. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic NTK study of cPIKANs, providing theoretical insight that clarifies and predicts their empirical performance.
